<p>This information covers some of the land-based regulatory issues and consents that may affect you and your land. You must comply with all the other legal requirements that apply to you and your land.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement conflicts with any statutory requirements for the management of the land, you must comply with those statutory requirements.</p>

<p>You will need to check if the land you’re entering into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>has scheduled monuments, historic or archaeological features</li>
    <li>is in a Site of Special Scientific Interest (<abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the land is affected by one of these it may affect:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>what you are able to do on that land</li>
    <li>whether you need to get consent before you enter the land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="scheduled-monuments-historic-and-archaeological-features-1">
    <span class="number">7.1 </span>Scheduled monuments, historic and archaeological features</h3>

<p>If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you must request a Sustainable Farming Incentive Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will tell you about any known historic and archaeological features on your land, including scheduled monuments. It will also tell you how they affect the actions you can take under the standards.</p>

<p>You must not complete action 4 (establish or maintain herbal leys) in the improved grassland soils standard on any area with historical or archaeological features identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>. You will still be paid for this area entered into the standard.</p>

<p>To request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>, you will need to register on the <a rel="external" href="https://hefer-data.org.uk" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> portal</a>. The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will be available when applications open. Once you’ve registered you can request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> by entering your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>). You will then be sent an email when the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> is available for you to download.</p>

<p>Before you enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, read more about:</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="sites-of-special-scientific-interest-sssis-1">
    <span class="number">7.2 </span>Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)</h3>

<p>If you have land in an <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> that you’re entering into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you may need consent from Natural England. This depends on which standard you’re applying for.</p>

<p>Check <a rel="external" href="http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&amp;chosenLayers=moncIndex,lbuildIndex,sssiIndex,sssiwalIndex,sssiscoIndex" class="govuk-link">MAGIC</a> to find out if there is an <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> on your land.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">Arable and horticultural soils standard</h4>

<p><abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is eligible for the introductory and intermediate levels of the arable and horticultural soils standard.</p>

<p>However, you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi" class="govuk-link">give notice to Natural England and get its consent</a> before you carry out any listed operations requiring Natural England consent on the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land to meet the actions in the introductory or intermediate levels under the arable and horticultural soils standard.</p>

<p>If consent is required, you may want to get this from Natural England before you enter the land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, to make sure you can complete the actions required under the arable and horticultural soils standard once your agreement starts.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="improved-grassland-soils-standard">Improved grassland soils standard</h4>

<p><abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is eligible for the introductory and intermediate levels of the improved grassland soils standard. However, you must not complete action 4 (establish and maintain herbal leys) on <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land.</p>

<p>While it is unlikely that the other actions under the introductory and intermediate levels of the improved grassland soils standard will be listed operations requiring Natural England consent, it is your responsibility to check.</p>

<p>If you intend to complete the other actions by carrying out a listed operation within the boundary of the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>, you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi" class="govuk-link">give notice to Natural England and get its consent</a> before you carry out any listed operations on the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="moorland-standard">Moorland standard</h4>

<p><abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is eligible for the introductory level of the moorland standard.</p>

<p>While it is unlikely that the actions under the introductory level of the moorland standard will be listed operations requiring Natural England consent, it is your responsibility to check.</p>

<p>If you intend to complete the actions by carrying out a listed operation within the boundary of the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>, you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi" class="govuk-link">give notice to Natural England and get its consent</a> before you carry out any listed operations on the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="find-out-if-you-need-sssi-consent">Find out if you need <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> consent</h4>

<p>You can find the listed operations requiring Natural England consent on your <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land by searching for the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> on the <a rel="external" href="https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx" class="govuk-link">designated sites system</a> (DSS). You can also find more information about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest#get-consent-to-carry-out-operations-on-your-land" class="govuk-link">getting consent to carry out operations on <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>If you need to get consent from Natural England to carry out a listed operation on <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land, you will need to provide the required information about the activities you’re proposing to do. Read the GOV.UK information about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest#what-to-include-when-you-request-consent" class="govuk-link">what details to include when you request consent</a>.</p>

<p>When you enter <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you declare that you understand the agreement does not operate as <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> consent and that you will apply separately for consent from Natural England, where relevant. You must supply evidence to show that the necessary consent was obtained from Natural England this if we ask for it.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="cross-compliance">
    <span class="number">7.3 </span>Cross compliance</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cross-compliance-2022" class="govuk-link">cross compliance rules</a> do not apply to an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. However, you still need to meet any regulatory requirements that apply to you or your land. Being in an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement does not remove these requirements.</p>

<p>You must follow the cross compliance rules if you:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>apply for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>
    </li>
    <li>have land in other rural payments schemes covered by these rules</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="protected-species">
    <span class="number">7.4 </span>Protected species</h3>

<p>You may need a wildlife licence if any of the actions in the standards you include in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application may affect protected species. You should keep the licence for evidence. You can read more information at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-wildlife-on-your-land" class="govuk-link">managing wildlife on your land on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="work-affecting-water">
    <span class="number">7.5 </span>Work affecting water</h3>

<p>If you’re doing any work that may affect watercourses, you may need consent from the Environment Agency, or the relevant internal drainage board or local authority.</p>
