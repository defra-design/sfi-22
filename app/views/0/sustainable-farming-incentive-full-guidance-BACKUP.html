    <span class="number">12. </span>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> arable and horticultural soils standard</h2>

<p>This covers what you need to know to complete the actions in the arable and horticultural soils standard of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>).</p>

<p>You only have to meet a requirement in this standard if the word ‘must’ is used. In this case, it’s part of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The other information is to help you, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<p>You can understand what you’re agreeing to do by reading this information on the arable and horticultural soils standard, together with your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement document and its terms and conditions.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-the-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard-will-improve-the-environment">How the arable and horticultural soils standard will improve the environment</h4>
<p>As soils are one of the most important natural assets, the arable and horticultural soils standard is focused on improving soil health, structure, organic matter, and biology. These improvements can benefit food production. They also contribute to a range of environmental and climate change outcomes, including better:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>water quality</li>
    <li>climate resilience</li>
    <li>biodiversity</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="eligible-land-for-the-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">Eligible land for the arable and horticultural soils standard</h4>

<p>You can only enter land into the arable and horticultural soils standard that:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>has an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
    <li>is an eligible ‘land type’</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="land-cover-2">Land cover</h4>
<p>Each land parcel has one or more registered land covers. These identify what broad category the land is.</p>

<p>You can view the land cover currently registered for each land parcel on your digital maps in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">Rural Payments service</a>. Read more information about <a href="#check-your-land-details" class="govuk-link">land cover and checking your digital maps before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The eligible land covers for the arable and horticultural soils standard are:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Arable Land</li>
    <li>Permanent Crops (only perennial crops)</li>
    <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Drain/Ditch/Dyke on a boundary</li>
    <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Track – natural surface</li>
</ul>

<p>If a land parcel has one or more of these eligible land covers, it will show as ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. When you select this land parcel, its total available area is included in your application. You cannot reduce it in your application.</p>

<p>A land parcel’s available area is only eligible for this standard if it is also an eligible land type.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="land-type-2">Land type</h4>

<p>The land type describes the detailed use of a land parcel’s broad category of land cover.</p>

<p>You can enter a land parcel into the arable and horticultural soils standard if its land type is cultivated arable land. This includes land used for horticultural crops, such as field vegetables, and temporary grassland. If there are drains, ditches, dykes or tracks with a natural surface in an otherwise cultivated arable land parcel, those can be viewed as part of that land parcel’s eligible land type area.</p>

<p>Temporary grassland is land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage for less than 5 consecutive years. You can choose to view this as either:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>arable land and enter it into the arable and horticultural soils standard</li>
    <li>improved grassland and enter it into the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-improved-grassland-soils-standard" class="govuk-link">improved grassland soils standard</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage for 5 consecutive years or more becomes classified as permanent grassland. If you enter temporary grassland into the arable and horticultural soils standard that becomes permanent grassland during the 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, that land will no longer be eligible for this standard. You may want to consider entering it into the improved grassland soils standard instead if it is improved permanent grassland.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="other-land-eligibility-issues-to-consider-1">
    <span class="number">12.1 </span>Other land eligibility issues to consider</h3>

<p>You should also consider the following land eligibility issues.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="land-in-another-agri-environment-scheme-agreement-1">Land in another agri-environment scheme agreement</h4>

<p>Land in an existing agri-environment scheme agreement, such as Countryside Stewardship, may also be eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Read the <a href="#how-an-sfi-standards-agreement-interacts-with-other-funding-schemes" class="govuk-link">interaction between <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> and other schemes</a> for more information.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="scheduled-monuments-historic-and-archaeological-features-2">Scheduled monuments, historic and archaeological features</h4>

<p>If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you must request a Sustainable Farming Incentive Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will tell you about any known historic and archaeological features on your land, including scheduled monuments. It will also tell you how they affect the actions you can take under the standards.</p>

<p>To request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>, you need to register on the <a rel="external" href="https://hefer-data.org.uk" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> portal</a>. The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will be available before applications open. Once registered, you can request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> by entering your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>). You will then be sent an email when the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> is available for you to download.</p>

<p>Before you enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, read more about:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <a rel="external" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/planning/consents/smc" class="govuk-link">scheduled monuments</a>, as you may need consent from Historic England</li>

</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="sites-of-special-scientific-interest">Sites of special scientific interest</h4>

<p><abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is eligible for the introductory and intermediate levels of the arable and horticultural soils standard.</p>

<p>However, you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi" class="govuk-link">give notice to Natural England and get its consent</a> before you carry out any listed operations requiring Natural England consent on the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land to meet the actions in the introductory or intermediate levels under the arable and horticultural soils standard.</p>

<p>If consent is required, you may want to get this from Natural England before you enter the land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, to make sure you can complete the actions required under the arable and horticultural soils standard once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement starts.</p>

<p>You can find the listed operations requiring Natural England consent on your <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land by searching for the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> on the <a rel="external" href="https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx" class="govuk-link">designated sites system</a>. You can also find more information about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest#get-consent-to-carry-out-operations-on-your-land" class="govuk-link">getting consent to carry out operations on <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="peaty-soil">Peaty soil</h4>

<p>Land with ‘peaty soil’ is eligible for this standard. Peaty soil means there is around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more.</p>

<p>You should not complete action 3 (add organic matter) on land with peaty soil, as explained later in this section. You’ll still be paid for this area even if you do not complete action 3. This is a temporary measure until specific measures on the sustainable management of peaty soils become available.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="organically-farmed-land">Organically farmed land</h4>

<p>To ensure value for public money, we expect that organically farmed land will be entered into the intermediate level of this standard.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-the-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard-works">
    <span class="number">12.2 </span>How the arable and horticultural soils standard works</h3>

<p>The arable and horticultural soils standard has a set of aims. You achieve these aims by completing the land management actions for this standard. The details of the actions explain what you need to do, when to do it and each action’s aim.</p>

<p>If you enter a land parcel into the arable and horticultural soils standard, it cannot be selected for the other 2 standards available in 2022. In future, some standards will be compatible with each other, and you’ll be able to have a land parcel in more than one standard where this is the case.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="different-levels">Different levels</h4>

<p>The actions are grouped into two levels:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>introductory</li>
    <li>intermediate</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the actions are the same in both levels. There is an additional action in the intermediate level.</p>

<p>You can select different levels for different land parcels entered into this standard. For example, you can enter one land parcel into the introductory level and another land parcel into the intermediate level.</p>

<p>An advanced level is likely to be available from 2023 and may include use of no-tillage techniques. You’ll be able to upgrade your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement annually to increase levels for existing standards in your agreement.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="payment">Payment</h4>

<p>The total annual payment you receive depends on the number of hectares (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) of eligible land you enter into each level.</p>

<table class="govuk-table">
    <thead class="govuk-table__head">
        <tr class="govuk-table__row">
            <th class="govuk-table__header" scope="col">Level</th>
            <th class="govuk-table__header" scope="col">Total annual payment</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody class="govuk-table__body">
        <tr class="govuk-table__row">
            <td class="govuk-table__cell">Introductory</td>
            <td class="govuk-table__cell">£22 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="govuk-table__row">
            <td class="govuk-table__cell">Intermediate</td>
            <td class="govuk-table__cell">£40 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This means if you enter:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> into the introductory level, your total annual payment is based on 20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> x £22 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</li>
    <li>20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of land into the intermediate level, your total annual payment is based on 20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> x £40 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are paid for all the eligible hectares entered into the standard, even if the action only has to be completed on a percentage area of that land.</p>

<p>Read more information about <a href="#getting-paid" class="govuk-link">payments</a>.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-complete-the-actions">When to complete the actions</h4>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement starts, you should complete the actions in this standard. This is explained in the details of the actions under ‘When to do it’.</p>

<p>If your agreement starts too late for you to complete an action, for example, establishing winter cover by the start of December, you can complete it within 12 months of your agreement start date.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="checking-the-progress-of-your-sfi-standards-agreement">Checking the progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h4>

<p>If we check the progress of your agreement, you’ll only be asked for evidence of what you’ve done to complete the action if it’s not clear that the aim has been achieved. The details of each action explain what evidence to keep.</p>

<p>Read the information on <a href="#checking-progress" class="govuk-link">checking progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</a>.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="summary-of-the-actions">
    <span class="number">12.3 </span>Summary of the actions</h3>

<p>The introductory level actions are:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>action 1: complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</li>
    <li>action 2: test soil organic matter</li>

    <li>action 4: have green cover on at least 70% of land in the standard over winter</li>
</ul>

<p>The intermediate level actions are:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>action 1: complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</li>
    <li>action 2: test soil organic matter</li>

    <li>action 4: have green cover on at least 50% of land in this level of the standard over winter and multi-species cover crops on an additional 20% of the land</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="details-of-the-actions">Details of the actions</h4>

<p>This section gives details of the actions in the arable and horticultural soils standard.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="action-1-complete-a-soil-assessment-and-produce-a-soil-management-plan">
    <span class="number">12.4 </span>Action 1: Complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-to-do">What to do</h4>

<p>You must complete an assessment of your soil and produce a written soil management plan covering all the land parcels entered into this standard.</p>

<p>If you already have a written soil management plan informed by a soil assessment, you can use it to meet this action.</p>

<p>To help us improve national data on the condition of England’s soils, you’ll need to provide some information when we ask you for it as part of the soils strategy once it’s launched. This will include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>basic information from your soil assessment</li>
    <li>the soil organic matter test results under action 2</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is one of the public goods that the standard is paying for and part of wider government measures in relation to our future soils strategy.</p>

<p>We’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about what basic information is needed and how to supply it to us.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-do-it">When to do it</h4>

<p>You must complete the soil assessment and produce the written soil management plan within the first 12 months of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. You must review the soil management plan each year of your agreement, adding any new soil analysis you undertake.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-do-it">How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. You can record the soil management plan on paper or digitally.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard" class="govuk-link">how to assess your soils and produce a soil management plan</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="the-actions-aim">The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim, which is for you to have both:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>assessed the soil for all the land entered into the standard</li>
    <li>produced a written soil management plan</li>
</ul>

<p>This will help you to plan how to increase the long-term health and productivity of your soil.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-evidence-to-keep">What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a record of your soil management plan, including your soil assessment. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="action-2-test-soil-organic-matter">
    <span class="number">12.5 </span>Action 2: Test soil organic matter</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-to-do-1">What to do</h4>

<p>You must make sure the soil for all the land parcels entered into this standard has been tested for soil organic matter (<abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr>) within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>You can use existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results to meet this action, but they cannot be more than 5 years old.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-do-it-1">When to do it</h4>

<p>During your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must make sure that each land parcel entered into this standard has been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>If your existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results reach 5 years old, you must retest that land parcel.</p>

<p>If you have not tested some or all of the land parcels entered into this standard for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years, you should try to do this during the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If this timing is not possible because the laboratory that does your <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> tests does not have capacity, you must make sure that:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the tests for these land parcels are done as soon as possible</li>
    <li>all of these land parcels have been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years by the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, you must also write to us explain why you have not:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>retested land parcels for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> when existing test results reached 5 years old</li>
    <li>completed <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> testing during the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement for land parcels not tested within the last 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p>You may choose to carry out this action at the same time as your other routine soil testing required in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/farming-rules-for-water-in-england" class="govuk-link">Farming Rules for Water</a>.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-do-it-1">How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. You may find it helpful to read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard" class="govuk-link">how to sample and test soil organic matter</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="the-actions-aim-1">The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that you have tested the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> on all the land parcels in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>This will enable you to plan how to increase the long-term health and productivity of your soil.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-evidence-to-keep-1">What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a record of the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="action-3-add-organic-matter">
    <span class="number">12.6 </span>Action 3: Add organic matter</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-to-do-2">What to do</h4>

<p>You must add organic matter to the soil of all the land parcels entered into this standard to improve soil health. This can be any kind of organic matter. There are examples of how you could add organic matter for this action under ‘How to do it’.</p>

<p>For the introductory level, this can include sown green cover crops established for action 4 (winter cover).</p>

<p>For the intermediate level, this can include multi-species green cover established for action 4 (winter cover).</p>

<p>If your land has ‘peaty soil’, you should not complete this action on that land because adding organic matter can speed up peat decomposition. Peaty soil means there is around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more. If there is peaty soil, you should read the guidance about adding soil organic matter that will be published before applications open.</p>

<p>You may already know if there is peaty soil on your land. If you do not know, the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results from completing action 2 will tell you. You’ll still be paid for this area in this standard, even if you cannot complete the action.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-do-it-2">When to do it</h4>

<p>You must do this on every land parcel entered into this standard at least once during your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. This could be done as part of your crop rotation.</p>

<p>By the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must have added organic matter to the soil of all the land parcels entered into this standard.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-do-it-2">How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="the-actions-aim-2">The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that, by the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, your soil organic matter levels have either:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>been maintained at a healthy level if this is already the case</li>
    <li>increased to healthy levels</li>
</ul>

<p>This will improve the long-term productivity of your soil, and also brings benefits for soil biodiversity and carbon storage.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-evidence-to-keep-2">What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You should keep photographs and other documentation to show what you’ve done to complete this action. This will help if it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the aim. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="action-4-winter-cover">
    <span class="number">12.7 </span>Action 4: Winter cover</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-to-do-3">What to do</h4>

<p>For the introductory level, over winter you must have a well-established green cover on at least 70% of the land entered into this level of the standard.
    Green cover is any crop or vegetation that covers bare soil to protect it over the winter. This could include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>autumn-sown crops such as winter cereals, linseed and oilseed rape</li>
    <li>a quick-growing cover crop</li>
    <li>leaving weedy stubbles that give sufficient cover to protect the soil</li>
</ul>

<p>For the intermediate level, over winter you must have:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>a well-established green cover on at least 50% of the land entered into this level of the standard</li>
    <li>multi-species cover crops on at least an additional 20% of the land entered into this level of the standard</li>
</ul>

<p>Multi-species cover crops are a mix of brassicas, legumes, grasses and cereals, grown together on the same area of land. You can choose the plant types and the proportion of each plant type that works for your farm.</p>

<p>A well-established green cover is where there is leafy vegetation, that’s sufficiently well grown to protect the soil, from the start of December. There should be minimal bare soil. If this is not possible, for example, due to prolonged adverse weather, you must let us know. Read the information about <a href="#checking-progress" class="govuk-link">checking progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</a>.</p>

<p>For both introductory and intermediate levels, you must not leave any land bare over winter if it is at high risk of erosion or run-off.</p>

<p>Existing areas of multi-species cover crops and temporary grassland can be used for this action.</p>

<p>For this action, you can also use areas of green cover or multi-species cover crops on your:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>2-metre or 1-metre cross compliance buffers required under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2022/gaec-1-establishment-of-buffer-strips-along-watercourses" class="govuk-link">GAEC 1</a>

    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you use a quick-growing cover crop as green cover, you do not have to destroy it.</p>

<p>You can graze the winter cover, but there still needs to be a well-established green cover over winter. You should not use or allow grazing to destroy the cover crop in these months.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-do-it-3">When to do it</h4>

<p>Each year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must have a well-established green cover (and multi-species cover at intermediate level) by the start of December.</p>

<p>You must keep the green cover (and multi-species cover) until the end of February, unless you’re establishing an early-sown spring crop.</p>

<p>Where conditions allow, you may destroy both types of cover before the end of February to establish an early-sown spring crop. You must not do this more than 6 weeks before you establish that spring crop.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-do-it-3">How to do it</h4>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard" class="govuk-link">how to establish green cover</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="the-actions-aim-3">The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that there is a well-established cover across all of the land used for this action over winter.</p>

<p>This will help protect the soil surface. It will also provide root growth that maintains soil structure, supports soil biology and minimises nutrient leaching, soil erosion and run-off.</p>

    <span class="number">13. </span>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> improved grassland soils standard</h2>

<p>This covers what you need to know to complete the actions in the improved grassland soils standard of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>).</p>

<p>You only have to meet a requirement in this standard if the word ‘must’ is used. In this case, it’s part of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The other information is to help you, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<p>You can understand what you’re agreeing to do by reading this information on the improved grassland soils standard, together with your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement document and its terms and conditions.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-the-improved-grassland-soils-standard-will-improve-the-environment">
    <span class="number">13.1 </span>How the improved grassland soils standard will improve the environment</h3>

<p>As soils are one of the most important natural assets, the improved grassland soils standard is focused on improving soil health, structure, organic matter, and biology. These improvements can benefit food production. They also contribute to a range of environmental and climate change outcomes, including better:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>water quality</li>
    <li>climate resilience</li>
    <li>biodiversity</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="eligible-land-for-the-improved-grassland-soils-standard">
    <span class="number">13.2 </span>Eligible land for the improved grassland soils standard</h3>

<p>You can only enter land into the improved grassland soils standard that:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>has an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
    <li>is an eligible ‘land type’</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="land-cover-3">Land cover</h4>

<p>Each land parcel has one or more registered land covers. These identify what broad category the land is.</p>

<p>You can view the land cover currently registered for each land parcel on your digital maps in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">Rural Payments service</a>. Read more information about <a href="#check-your-land-details" class="govuk-link">land cover and checking your digital maps before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The eligible land covers for the improved grassland soils standard are:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Arable Land (only if its land type is improved temporary grassland)</li>
    <li>Permanent Grassland (only if its land type is improved permanent grassland)</li>
    <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Drain/Ditch/Dyke on a boundary</li>
    <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Track – natural surface</li>
</ul>

<p>If a land parcel has one or more of these eligible land covers, it will show as ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. When you select this land parcel, its total available area is included in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. You cannot reduce it in your application.</p>

<p>A land parcel’s available area is only eligible for this standard if it is also an eligible land type.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="land-type-3">Land type</h4>

<p>The land type describes the detailed use of a land parcel’s broad category of land cover.</p>

<p>You can enter a land parcel into the improved grassland soils standard if its land type is improved grassland. This includes both permanent and temporary grassland, as long as it’s improved grassland. If there are drains, ditches, dykes or tracks with a natural surface in an otherwise improved grassland parcel, those can be viewed as part of that land parcel’s eligible land type area.</p>

<p>To qualify as improved grassland, the land will have been managed in some or all of the following ways:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>regular re-seeding, or has been reseeded within the last 15 years</li>
    <li>regular fertilising with typically at least 100 kg per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of nitrogen as an artificial compound fertiliser or animal manures and slurries</li>
    <li>boom spraying herbicide to treat weeds</li>
    <li>active, well-maintained field drains</li>
    <li>taking any conserved forage as silage, haylage or hay, usually more than once a year</li>
</ul>

<p>Improved grassland will usually have a high coverage of ryegrass and white clover.</p>

<p>Permanent grassland is land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage, which has not been included in the crop rotation for 5 or more consecutive years. It may have been reseeded during that time.</p>

<p>Temporary grassland is land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage for less than 5 consecutive years. You can choose to view this as either:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>improved grassland and enter it into the improved grassland soils standard</li>
    <li>arable land and enter it into the arable and horticultural soils standard</li>
</ul>

<p>Unimproved grassland is not eligible for this standard. Unimproved grassland means land that has not been cultivated within the last 15 years. For example, it will not have been cultivated during this 15-year period by:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>sowing or reseeding</li>
    <li>ploughing, or an activity that breaks the soil surface or disrupts the subsoil</li>
    <li>adding artificial fertiliser or soil improvers</li>
</ul>

<p>This unimproved grassland may be eligible for Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>) grassland options. A low and no input grassland standard should be available in <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> from 2024.</p>

<p>Unimproved grassland will usually have a diverse sward made up of a range of grasses and wildflowers.</p>

<p>If you have recently created a species rich sward, for example, under a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement, you cannot enter that area into this standard. Read the <a href="#how-an-sfi-standards-agreement-interacts-with-other-funding-schemes" class="govuk-link">interaction between <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> and other schemes</a> for more information.</p>

<p>In your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, the total available area of a land parcel must be improved grassland. If part of a land parcel’s available area includes an ineligible land type for this standard, you must not select that land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. It’s not possible for you to reduce the available area in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p>For example, you must not select a land parcel if its total available area is:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> based on its Permanent Grassland land cover, but only 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> is improved permanent grassland</li>
    <li>10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> based on its Arable land cover, but only 5 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> is improved temporary grassland</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="other-land-eligibility-issues-to-consider-2">
    <span class="number">13.3 </span>Other land eligibility issues to consider</h3>

<p>You should also consider the following land eligibility issues.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="land-in-another-agri-environment-scheme-agreement-2">Land in another agri-environment scheme agreement</h4>

<p>Land in an existing agri-environment scheme agreement, such as <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>, may also be eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-an-sfi-standards-agreement-interacts-with-other-funding-schemes" class="govuk-link">interaction between <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> and other schemes</a> for more information.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="scheduled-monuments-historic-and-archaeological-features-3">Scheduled monuments, historic and archaeological features</h4>

<p>If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you must request a Sustainable Farming Incentive Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will tell you about any known historic and archaeological features on your land, including scheduled monuments. It will also tell you how they affect the actions you can take under the standards.</p>

<p>You must not complete action 4 (establish or maintain herbal leys) in the improved grassland standard on any area with historic or archaeological features identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>. You’ll still be paid for this area entered into the standard.</p>

<p>To request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>, you need to register on the <a rel="external" href="https://hefer-data.org.uk/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> portal</a>. The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will be available before applications open. Once registered, you can request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> by entering your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>). You will then be sent an email when the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> is available for you to download.</p>

<p>Before you enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, read more about:</p>

</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="sites-of-special-scientific-interest-sssis-2">Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)</h4>

<p><abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is eligible for the introductory and intermediate levels of the improved grassland soils standard. However, you must not complete action 4 (establish and maintain herbal leys) on <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land.</p>

<p>While it is unlikely that the other actions under the introductory and intermediate levels of the improved grassland soils standard will be listed operations requiring Natural England consent, it is your responsibility to check.</p>

<p>If you intend to complete the other actions by carrying out a listed operation within the boundary of the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>, you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi" class="govuk-link">give notice to Natural England and get its consent</a> before you carry out any listed operations on the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="peaty-soil-1">Peaty soil</h4>

<p>Land with ‘peaty soil’ is eligible for this standard. Peaty soil means there is around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more.</p>

<p>You should not complete action 4 (establish or maintain herbal leys ) of this standard on land with peaty soil as explained below. You’ll still be paid for this area, even if you do not complete action 4. This is a temporary measure until specific measures on the sustainable management of peaty soils become available.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="organically-farmed-land-1">Organically farmed land</h4>

<p>To ensure value for public money, we expect that organically farmed land will be entered into the intermediate level of this standard.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-the-improved-grassland-soils-standard-works">
    <span class="number">13.4 </span>How the improved grassland soils standard works</h3>

<p>The improved grassland soils standard has a set of aims. You achieve these aims by completing the land management actions for this standard. The details of the actions explain what you need to do, when to do it and each action’s aim.</p>

<p>If you enter a land parcel into the improved grassland soils standard, it cannot be selected for the other 2 standards available in 2022. In future, some standards will be compatible with each other, and you’ll be able to have a land parcel in more than one standard, where this is the case.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="different-levels-1">Different levels</h4>

<p>The actions are grouped into two levels:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>introductory</li>
    <li>intermediate</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the actions are the same in both levels. There’s one additional action in the intermediate level.</p>

<p>You can select different levels for different land parcels entered into this standard. For example, you can enter one land parcel into the introductory level and another land parcel into the intermediate level.</p>

<p>An advanced level is likely to be available from 2023 onwards. You’ll be able to upgrade your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement annually to increase levels for existing standards in your agreement.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="payment-1">Payment</h4>

<p>The total annual payment you receive depends on the number of hectares (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) of eligible land you enter into each level.</p>

<table class="govuk-table">
    <thead class="govuk-table__head">
        <tr class="govuk-table__row">
            <th class="govuk-table__header" scope="col">Level</th>
            <th class="govuk-table__header" scope="col">Total annual payment</th>

            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This means if you enter:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> into the introductory level, your total annual payment is based on 20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> x £28 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</li>
    <li>20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> into the intermediate level, your total annual payment is based on 20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> x £58 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are paid for all the eligible hectares entered into the standard, even if the action only has to be completed on a percentage area of that land.</p>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement starts, you should complete the actions in this standard. This is explained in the details of the actions under ‘When to do it’.</p>

<p>If your agreement starts too late for you to complete an action, you can complete it within 12 months of your agreement start date.</p>

    <span class="number">13.6 </span>Action 1: Complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-to-do-4">What to do</h4>

<p>You must complete an assessment of your soil and produce a written soil management plan covering all the land parcels entered into this standard.</p>

<p>If you already have a written soil management plan informed by a soil assessment, you can use it to meet this action.</p>

<p>To help us improve national data on the condition of England’s soils, you’ll need to provide some information when we ask you for it as part of the soils strategy once it’s launched. This will include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>basic information from your soil assessment</li>
    <li>the soil organic matter test results under action 2</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is one of the public goods that the standard is paying for and part of wider government measures in relation to our future soils strategy.</p>

<p>We’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about what basic information is needed and how to supply it to us.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-do-it-4">When to do it</h4>

<p>You must complete the soil assessment and produce the written soil management plan within the first 12 months of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. You must review the soil management plan each year of your agreement, adding any new soil analysis you do.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-do-it-4">How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. You can record the soil management plan on paper or digitally.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the guidance about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-improved-grassland-soils-standard" class="govuk-link">how to assess your soils and produce a soil management plan</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="the-actions-aim-4">The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim, which is for you to have:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>assessed the soil for all the land entered into this standard</li>
    <li>produced a written soil management plan for that land</li>
</ul>

<p>This will help you to plan how to increase the long-term health and productivity of your soil.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-evidence-to-keep-4">What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a record of your soil management plan, including your soil assessment. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="action-2-test-soil-organic-matter-1">
    <span class="number">13.7 </span>Action 2: Test soil organic matter</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-to-do-5">What to do</h4>

<p>You must make sure the soil for all the land parcels entered into this standard have been tested for soil organic matter (<abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr>) within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>You can use existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results to meet this action, but they cannot be more than 5 years old.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-do-it-5">When to do it</h4>

<p>During your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must make sure that each land parcel entered into this standard has been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>If your existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results reach 5 years old, you must retest that land parcel.</p>

<p>If you have not tested some or all of the land parcels entered into this standard for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years, you should try to do this during the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If this timing is not possible because the laboratory that does your <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> tests does not have capacity, you must make sure that:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the tests for these land parcels are done as soon as possible</li>
    <li>all of these land parcels have been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years by the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, you must also write to us to explain why you have not:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>retested land parcels for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> when existing test results reached 5 years old</li>
    <li>completed <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> testing during the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement for land parcels not tested within the last 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p>You may choose to carry out this action at the same time as your other routine soil testing required in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/farming-rules-for-water-in-england" class="govuk-link">Farming Rules for Water</a>.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-do-it-5">How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. You may find it helpful to read the guidance about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-improved-grassland-soils-standard" class="govuk-link">how to sample and test soil organic matter</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="the-actions-aim-5">The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that you have tested the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> on all the land parcels entered into this standard within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>This will help you to plan how to increase the long-term health and productivity of your soil.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-evidence-to-keep-5">What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a record of the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="action-3-minimise-bare-ground-over-winter">
    <span class="number">13.8 </span>Action 3: Minimise bare ground over winter</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-to-do-6">What to do</h4>

<p>You must make sure that no more than 5% of the total area of land entered into the standard is left bare, or becomes bare, over winter.</p>

<p>Bare land is any area of land where the soil is not covered by vegetation and is directly exposed to the elements.</p>

<p>You must not leave any land bare over winter if it’s at high risk of erosion or run-off.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-do-it-6">When to do it</h4>

<p>Each year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must have no more than 5% of the land entered into this standard as bare ground from the start of December until the end of February.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-do-it-6">How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the guidance about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-improved-grassland-soils-standard" class="govuk-link">how to avoid bare ground</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="the-actions-aim-6">The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that there’s minimal bare ground across all of the land entered into this standard over winter.</p>

<p>This will help to protect the soil surface. It will also provide root growth that maintains soil structure, supports soil biology and minimises nutrient leaching, soil erosion and runoff.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-evidence-to-keep-6">What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You should keep photographs and other documentation to show what you’ve done to complete this action. This will help if it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the aim. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="action-4-establish-or-maintain-herbal-leys">
    <span class="number">13.9 </span>Action 4: Establish or maintain herbal leys</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-to-do-7">What to do</h4>

<p>For the intermediate level only, you must establish and maintain herbal leys with a mixture of grasses, legumes, and herbs on at least 15% of the land entered into this level of the standard. You can maintain an existing herbal ley to meet this.</p>

<p>For this action, you can also use herbal leys located on your:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>2-metre or 1-metre cross compliance buffers required under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2022/gaec-1-establishment-of-buffer-strips-along-watercourses" class="govuk-link">GAEC 1</a>

    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can do this on a single area of land for the duration of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Alternatively, you can move the area used for the herbal leys around the land parcels entered into this standard each year.</p>

<p>You must not establish herbal leys on:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>any area that’s a Site of Special Scientific Interest (<abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>)</li>
    <li>any area with historic or archaeological features, as identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You should not complete this action on any area of ‘peaty soil’. Peaty soil means there’s around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more. You may already know if there is peaty soil on your land. If you do not know, the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results from completing action 2 will tell you.</p>

<p>You’ll still be paid for this area, even though you cannot complete the action on it.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-do-it-7">When to do it</h4>

<p>You must establish the herbal ley in the first 12 months of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. If you’ve already established a herbal ley, you can maintain it to meet this action.</p>

<p>You must maintain the herbal ley on at least 15% of the land entered into this level of the standard for the 3-year duration of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-do-it-7">How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="the-actions-aim-7">The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that there is a sward with a mix of grasses, legumes and herbs on at least 15% of the land entered into this standard.</p>

<p>This will provide varied root structures to improve and maintain the soil’s structure, carbon, biology and fertility.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-evidence-to-keep-7">What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You should keep photographs and other documentation to show what you’ve done to complete this action. This will help if it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the aim. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

    <span class="number">15. </span>
    <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> annual health and welfare review</h2>
<p>The annual health and welfare review is part of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) offer in 2022.</p>

<p>We will start testing the first annual health and welfare reviews in summer 2022, and we’ll steadily increase these by invitation over the summer before opening to eligible keepers in autumn 2022.</p>

<p>Later this year, we will publish more information on GOV.UK about when applications will open and how to apply. This funding will be available for three years, after which we will review the situation.</p>

<p>Livestock keepers can get funding for a vet or vet-led team of your choice to visit your farm and carry out an annual review of your eligible livestock.  </p>

<p>The review sits alongside the environmental land management standards. You do not need to have an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement to be eligible to apply for the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> annual health and welfare review. </p>

<p>This review is designed to:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>reduce endemic diseases such as bovine viral disease (<abbr title="bovine viral disease">BVD</abbr>) in cattle, porcine reproductive and respiratory disease (<abbr title="porcine reproductive and respiratory disease">PRRS</abbr>) in pigs and resistance to parasite treatments in sheep</li>
    <li>improve the welfare of your animals</li>
    <li>increase productivity</li>
    <li>ensure your use of veterinary medicines and vaccines is appropriate</li>
    <li>be primarily for the farmer, and not used for inspections or compliance</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="your-eligibilityto-apply-for-this-funding">Your eligibility to apply for this funding</h4>

<p>To be eligible to apply for funding under the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> annual health and welfare review, your business, the Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) that’s applying, must be eligible for the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>). This means the <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> must have at least 5 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible land and 5 or more <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements on 16 May 2022.</p>

<p>The review will be made available to those not currently eligible for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> as soon as possible, so a wider range of livestock keepers can apply for this funding.</p>

<p>If you meet this <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligibility requirement, you can apply for the annual health and welfare review if you’re a livestock keeper with more than any of the following:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>10 cattle</li>
    <li>20 sheep</li>
    <li>50 pigs</li>
</ul>

<p>These livestock must be registered in England.</p>

<p>If you have more than one species of livestock, such as cattle and sheep, and the number of livestock in each species exceeds the minimum threshold, you can have one review annually for each species.</p>

<p>If the livestock are kept at different geographical locations, you may be eligible for more than one annual review. More information about how this will work will be published on GOV.UK before applications open.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-much-funding-you-can-apply-for">How much funding you can apply for</h4>

<p>There is a payment for each species. It is not a payment for each animal.</p>

<p>This payment will help you cover the costs for:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the vet</li>
    <li>testing for endemic diseases and conditions</li>
    <li>your time</li>
</ul>

<p>The payment for each species is different. This is because the required testing for some species may take longer to do, and some results cost more to analyse.</p>

<p>You’ll be paid:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>£684 for a pig review</li>
    <li>£436 for a sheep review</li>
    <li>£522 for a beef cattle review</li>
    <li>£372 for a dairy cattle review</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-the-review-will-include">What the review will include</h4>

<p>The review will require:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>2 to 3 hours of a vet and farmer’s time, looking at health and welfare in a way that meets the farmer’s and vet’s priorities for the farm</li>
    <li>a written report prepared by the vet with agreed recommendations and actions to improve the livestock’s health and welfare</li>
    <li>testing to industry standards for a priority endemic disease or condition, depending on species including <abbr title="bovine viral disease">BVD</abbr> in cattle, <abbr title="porcine reproductive and respiratory disease">PRRS</abbr> in pigs or to find out how effective the anthelmintic being used is in sheep</li>
    <li>the vet sharing some information relevant to the health and welfare of the farmer’s livestock, including test results, with us</li>
</ul>

<p>Optional areas may include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>a check of your biosecurity measures and advice on improving them</li>
    <li>recommendations about medicines used on your farm including antibiotics and vaccinations</li>
    <li>advice on grants and sources of funding available</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-the-review-will-be-completed-by-the-vet">How the review will be completed by the vet</h4>

<p>It is expected that each review will take between 2 to 3 hours of your, and the vet’s, time. This does not include the time taken to carry out the required testing for endemic diseases and conditions.</p>

<p>As part of the review, the vet will discuss with you your test results, and recommend actions you can take to improve health and welfare based on testing and their time on the farm.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-happens-after-the-review">What happens after the review</h4>

<p>Once the vet has completed the review, they will provide you with a report that includes:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the agreed priority recommendations and actions for you to improve the health and welfare of your livestock</li>
    <li>advice about how you can monitor your livestock in future to identify how things are changing throughout the year</li>
    <li>advice about how you can record data as part of the review</li>
    <li>information about where you can find further support</li>
</ul>

<p>This information will not be shared with us or used for any regulatory or site visit purposes.</p>

<p>The vet, or one of their team, will record some information about the review, including test results online. This information will be anonymised and stored securely. It will give us a better understanding of the health and welfare of the national herds and flock. It will not be used for site visits or other compliance checks.</p>

<p>We will publish more information on GOV.UK later this year about when applications will open and how to apply.</p>

    <span class="number">17.1 </span>Action 1: Complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</h3>

<p>To complete a soil assessment, you’ll usually need to:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>assess soil type, texture, structure and biology</p>
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>identify historic features</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Try to assess the soil and take soil samples when it is not too dry or wet. Spring or autumn are usually the best time of year to complete a soil assessment.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="assess-soil-type-structure-and-biology">Assess soil type, structure and biology</h4>

<p>The main soil types are:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>sand</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>silt</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>clay</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>loam</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>chalk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>peat</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out more about these soil types in the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) information about the <a rel="external" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/characteristics-different-soils" class="govuk-link">characteristics of different soils</a>.</p>

<p>To check the soil type, you can search for your location in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.landis.org.uk/soilscapes/" class="govuk-link">Soilscapes soil types viewer</a> produced by the National Soil Resources Institute of Cranfield University.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="soil-texture">Soil texture</h4>

<p>Soil texture depends on the mix of sand, silt and clay in the soil.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/32016?category=9001" class="govuk-link">read Natural England’s Technical Information Note about soil texture</a>, which includes the main soil texture types and what you’re likely to feel and see for each texture class.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="soil-structure-and-compaction">Soil structure and compaction</h4>

<p>Soil structure affects how air and water move in the soil and how well crops and grass can grow.</p>

<p>You can choose how you assess soil structure. To do this, you can:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="soil-biology">Soil biology</h4>

<p>Soil biology includes the presence of earthworms and other visible creatures, soil organic matter and microorganisms.</p>

<p>You can use a soil sample to count earthworms and other visible creatures, such as millipedes and spiders. To do this, you can use the same soil samples taken to assess soil structure and soil organic matter (action 2) or dig another pit.</p>

<p>The soil organic matter testing you do under action 2 will tell you about the soil organic matter.</p>

<p>Microorganisms can be quite difficult to assess yourself, but if you’d like to find out more you can ask a commercial laboratory to test soil samples for this.</p>

<p>To find out more about soil biology, you can read the AHDB factsheet: <a rel="external" href="https://projectblue.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Imported%20Publication%20Docs/IntroSoiBiology_WEB2074_280219.pdf" class="govuk-link">An introduction to Soil Biology</a>.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="assess-risks-relating-to-soil">
    <span class="number">17.2 </span>Assess risks relating to soil</h3>

<p>You can assess the risks relating to soil from:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>runoff or soil erosion, including connection to water bodies or sensitive habitats</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>wind erosion</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>nitrogen leaching</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve assessed these risks you can make an overall assessment of the risk for your land.</p>

<p>You can follow the steps below to assess risks to your soil.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1-risk-of-runoff-and-soil-erosion">Step 1: Risk of runoff and soil erosion</h4>

<p>Runoff occurs when there is more water than land can absorb, meaning that water drains away directly over the surface of land. This can carry fine soil particles, nutrients, pesticides and manures to water bodies, such as ponds, lakes, ditches, stream and rivers. This can cause pollution and potentially harm animals and plants that live in the water bodies.</p>

<p>Runoff can wash material directly from a land parcel into a water body. It can also travel in other ways, such as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>through yards</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>along tracks or roads</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>via field drains</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To assess the risk of runoff and soil erosion, you can consider:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>the gradient of a slope - steeper slopes have a greater risk of runoff and soil erosion as water runs more quickly over the surface</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>how long a slope is</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>soil texture - this affects whether rain soaks into the soil or runs over the surface, and how easily soil particles will be washed away</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>how often the land floods - it is more susceptible to erosion and runoff if it floods frequently</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>how close the land is to a water body</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1a-assess-the-gradient-of-the-slope">Step 1a: Assess the gradient of the slope</h4>

<p>You can choose how to measure the gradient of a slope. For example, you could use a clinometer.</p>

<p>The risk of runoff is:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>high for steep slopes - these are slopes with an angle of 7 degrees or more (12%+ gradient)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>moderate for moderate slopes - slopes with an angle of 3-7 degrees (5-12% gradient)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>lower for gentle slopes - slopes with an angle of 2-3 degrees (3-5% gradient)</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1b-assess-other-runoff-and-erosion-factors">Step 1b: Assess other runoff and erosion factors</h4>

<p>After you’ve assessed the risk of runoff for each land parcel based on the gradient of the slope, you can adjust the runoff and erosion risk assessment to reflect:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>slope length</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>soil texture</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>flooding frequency</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>history of runoff or ponding</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, lighter soils on moderate slopes have a high risk of runoff. Land that regularly floods (at least once every 3 years) has a high risk of erosion or runoff.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1c-assess-how-close-land-is-to-water">Step 1c: Assess how close land is to water</h4>

<p>The risk of runoff may be less significant if the land parcel is not close or well connected to a water body, such as a pond, lake, ditch, stream or river. You can assess the risk of runoff based on how close the land parcel is to a water body.</p>

<p>The risk of runoff is:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>high – if the land parcel you’re assessing is directly next to a water body</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>moderate – if the land parcel is separated from a water body by at least one other land parcel</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>lower – if the land parcel is some distance for land from a water body</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1d-risk-based-on-history-of-runoff-or-ponding">Step 1d: risk based on history of runoff or ponding</h4>

<p>You can then refine the risk assessment for each land parcel based on the history of runoff and ponding. The risk of runoff is:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>high - if visible runoff and ponding happens to the land you’re assessing in most years during wet periods</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>moderate - if visible runoff happens in most years during wet periods</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>lower - if runoff happens occasionally during wet periods</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1e-refine-your-risk-of-runoff-and-soil-erosion">Step 1e: refine your risk of runoff and soil erosion</h4>

<p>Once you’ve considered the risks above, you can use your experience and judgement to adjust the level of risk for each land parcel, taking into account additional factors such as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>soil structure</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>organic matter content - higher organic content usually increases the ability of soil to absorb water</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>valley features, as they tend to concentrate runoff water</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>long unbroken slopes</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>land use</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-2-risk-of-wind-erosion">Step 2: Risk of wind erosion</h4>

<p>Wind erosion is most likely on fine sandy soils and light peaty soils. It will be worse in dry conditions or where there is drainage, bare land or fine dry seedbeds.</p>

<p>Signs of wind erosion include drifting soil, buried seedlings, and soil blown into hedgerows, ditches and onto nearby roads.</p>

<p>If there are fine sandy soils or light peaty soils and wind erosion occurs at least once every 3 years, identify this area as high risk in your soil assessment. If there are chalk or limestone soils, the risk is likely to be moderate. Other soil types are likely to be lower risk.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-3-risk-of-nitrogen-leaching">Step 3: Risk of nitrogen leaching</h4>

<p>Light sandy and shallow soils are less able to store nitrogen. It can be easily lost as water filters through the soil. If you have land parcels with this type of soil where you add nitrogen-based fertilisers, identify this as being at risk of nitrogen leaching.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-4-make-an-overall-risk-assessment">Step 4: Make an overall risk assessment</h4>

<p>Once you’ve assessed all the risks above, and made any adjustments you judge are relevant, you can make your overall risk assessment for your land. You can do this by classifying the overall risks as very high, high, moderate or lower. For example:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>if there are a number of high risks, it’s likely to be an overall very high risk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>if there are some high risks, some mediums and a few lower risks, it’s likely to be an overall high risk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>if there are mainly medium and lower risks, it’s likely to be an overall medium risk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>If there are mainly lower risks, it’s likely to be an overall lower risk</p>
    </li>
</ul>

    <span class="number">17.4 </span>Action 2: Test soil organic matter</h3>

<p id="test-som">Testing soil organic matter will help you assess the health of your soil. To do this, you can:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>take soil samples</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>analyse the soil samples, which will usually be done by a commercial laboratory</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-select-a-sample-area">How to select a sample area</h4>

<p>Before you take soil samples, you’ll need to select your sample areas. A sample area is an area of land across which you will take soil samples.</p>

<p>When you select sample areas, try to choose areas which have:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>a similar soil type</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>been managed in a similar way in the past</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If the soil type and past management is similar, you can take account of the size of the land parcels:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>select one sample area in each land parcel if you consider the land parcels to be an average size</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>select a number of smaller sample areas within a large land parcel</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>combine small land parcels into a single sample area, but try to avoid the combined area being too large as this will reduce the soil testing analysis accuracy</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The arable and horticultural soils standard requires that during your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, each land parcel has been tested for soil organic matter within the last 5 years. Make sure you meet this requirement of the standard if you combine a number of small land parcels into a single sample area. For example, the overall combined area could include samples from each land parcel.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-take-soil-samples">When to take soil samples</h4>

<p>You may find it easier to take soil samples in the spring or autumn, before you cultivate the land. This will also avoid damaging the crop.</p>

<p>It is advisable to avoid taking soil samples if:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>the soil is waterlogged or very dry, because it may reduce the quality of the soil analysis</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>manure or slurry has been applied within around the last 3 months, as it may affect the soil organic matter levels and give you a false result</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-take-soil-samples">How to take soil samples</h4>

<p>You can take multiple soil samples on each sample area and combine them into a single sample that represents the soil across each sample area.</p>

<p>You can choose how many soil samples you take in each sample area, but try to take enough to gain a good understanding of the soil organic matter across each sample area.</p>

<p>Avoid taking soil samples on areas of land where:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>there are historical or archaeological features, as identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>features like manure heaps, pylons, gateways, headlands and around trees, as these features can distort the soil analysis results</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To get a representative sample of the sample area you’re testing, aim to take cores up to a depth of around 15cm (6 inches).</p>

<p>You can follow these steps to take soil samples for soil organic matter:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Walk a ‘W’ pattern across the sample area, with 5-7 stops along each leg of the ‘W’.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>This will give you around 25 soil samples across the sample area.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Combine the soil samples in a clean plastic bag, to form one bulk sample of about 0.5kg.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to assess the soil structure and soil biology (for action 1), at 5 to 10 stops across the whole ‘W’ you can:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>assess topsoil structure</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>count and record earthworms</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can also assess the subsoil structure at 3 of the stops, one of which should be on a headland.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the AHDB guidance about <a rel="external" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/how-to-collect-a-soil-sample" class="govuk-link">how to collect a soil sample</a>.</p>

<p>The image below shows how you can walk a ‘W’ and take soil samples across a sample area.</p>

</figure>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-test-the-soil-samples">How to test the soil samples</h4>

<p>If you have the right equipment and expertise, you can test the soil samples yourself. However, sending your soil samples to a commercial laboratory will usually give more accurate results. You can find a list of <a rel="external" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/soil-and-forage-testing-companies" class="govuk-link">laboratories where you can send your soil samples</a> on the AHDB website.</p>

<p>Try to use the same laboratory and method of testing if you are repeating the tests over a number of years. Having a consistent approach will help you see how the soil organic matter is increasing or decreasing over time.</p>

<p>If you use a laboratory, you can ask them to test organic matter content by using the:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>loss on ignition test (as a minimum level of analysis)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Dumas test, which uses dry combustion to burn the samples</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="action-3-add-organic-matter-1">
    <span class="number">17.5 </span>Action 3: Add organic matter</h3>

<p>To add organic matter to the soil, you can:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>apply organic manure</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>use green manures, catch crops or cover crops</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>chop or leave, or incorporate, straw</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>introduce grass or herbal leys into an arable rotation</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>include legume species or legume rich mixes in rotations</p>
    </li>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="peaty-soil-2">Peaty soil</h4>

<p>If the soil type is peaty, the arable and horticultural soils standard requires that you should not complete this action because adding organic matter can speed up peat decomposition. Peaty soil means there is around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="action-4-winter-cover-1">
    <span class="number">17.6 </span>Action 4: Winter cover</h3>

<p>You can use crops or vegetation that provide a green cover to protect bare soil over the winter. These include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>autumn-sown crops such as winter cereals, linseed and oilseed rape</p>
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>leaving weedy stubbles that give sufficient cover to protect the soil</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The crops or vegetation you choose need to be:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>suitable for winter sowing</p>
    </li>
    <li>

</ul>

<p>*frost tolerant to provide adequate cover over winter</p>

<p>If you’re using a quick-growing cover crop, you may find it helpful to read the AHDB <a rel="external" href="https://projectblue.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Imported%20Publication%20Docs/IS41%20Opportunities%20for%20cover%20crops%20in%20conventional%20arable-rotations%20(2018).pdf" class="govuk-link">information sheet about cover crops</a>.</p>

<p>If you enter land into the intermediate level of the arable and horticultural soils standard, you’ll need to include multi-species cover crops on the required (20%) area of land entered into this level of the standard.</p>

<p>Multi-species cover crops means a mix of brassicas, legumes, and grasses/cereals, grown together on the same area of land. You can choose the plant types and proportion of each plant type that works for your farm and crop rotation.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-establish-winter-cover">How to establish winter cover</h4>

<p>To achieve a well-established winter cover with leafy vegetation to protect the soil from the start of December, you may want to establish it in late summer or early autumn.</p>

<p>If you’re in an area with a shorter growing season you may need to choose plants that germinate and grow in cooler weather.</p>

<p>If you’re using weedy stubbles for winter cover, to meet the requirement in the arable and horticultural soils standard they need to give sufficient cover to protect the soil. This is likely to be the case if the stubbles follow the harvest of:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-destroy-winter-cover">How to destroy winter cover</h4>

<p>The arable and horticultural soils standard requires you to retain the winter cover until the end of February, unless you’re planting an early-sown spring crop.</p>

<p>How you destroy the winter cover is up to you. You can graze your cover crop with livestock and incorporate it into your soils to increase organic matter (this also counts towards action 3 in the arable and horticultural soils standard).</p>

<p>Avoid using heavy machinery, or heavy grazing, on wet soils to destroy the winter cover as this can cause soil compaction.</p>

    <span class="number">18.1 </span>Action 1: Complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</h3>

<p>To complete a soil assessment, you’ll usually need to:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>assess soil type, texture, structure and biology</p>
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>identify historic features</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Try to assess the soil and take soil samples when it is not too dry or wet. Spring or autumn are usually the best time of year to complete a soil assessment.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="assess-soil-type-structure-and-biology-1">Assess soil type, structure and biology</h4>

<p>The main soil types are:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

    <li>
        <p>chalk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>peat</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out more about these soil types in the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) information about the <a rel="external" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/characteristics-different-soils" class="govuk-link">characteristics of different soils</a>.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="soil-texture-1">Soil texture</h4>

<p>Soil texture depends on the mix of sand, silt and clay in the soil.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/32016?category=9001" class="govuk-link">read Natural England’s Technical Information Note about soil texture</a>, which includes the main soil texture types and what you’re likely to feel and see for each texture class.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="soil-structure-and-compaction-1">Soil structure and compaction</h4>

<p>Soil structure affects how air and water move in the soil and how well crops and grass can grow.</p>

<p>You can choose how you assess soil structure. To do this, you can:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>look at the soil surface to assess the quality of the crop or grass sward and identify areas where there may be soil structure issues</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>take a soil sample by digging out a block of soil to a depth of around 30cm (12 inches)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>score the soil sample by visually assessing it</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>It may save time if you assess soil structure when you <a href="#test-som" class="govuk-link">test soil organic matter</a>.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="soil-biology-1">Soil biology</h4>

<p>Soil biology includes the presence of earthworms and other visible creatures, soil organic matter and microorganisms.</p>

<p>You can use a soil sample to count earthworms and other visible creatures, such as millipedes and spiders. To do this, you can use the same soil samples taken to assess soil structure and soil organic matter (action 2) or dig another pit.</p>

<p>The soil organic matter testing you do under action 2 will tell you about the soil organic matter.</p>

<p>Microorganisms can be quite difficult to assess yourself, but if you’d like to find out more you can ask a commercial laboratory to test soil samples for this.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="assess-risks-relating-to-soil-1">
    <span class="number">18.2 </span>Assess risks relating to soil</h3>

<p>You can assess the risks relating to soil from:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>runoff or soil erosion, including connection to water bodies or sensitive habitats</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>wind erosion</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>nitrogen leaching</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve assessed these risks you can make an overall assessment of the risk for your land.</p>

<p>You can follow the steps below to assess risks to your soil.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1-risk-of-runoff-and-soil-erosion-1">Step 1: Risk of runoff and soil erosion</h4>

<p>Runoff occurs when there is more water than land can absorb, meaning that water drains away directly over the surface of land. This can carry fine soil particles, nutrients, pesticides and manures to water bodies, such as ponds, lakes, ditches, stream and rivers. This can cause pollution and potentially harm animals and plants that live in the water bodies.</p>

<p>Runoff can wash material directly from a land parcel into a water body. It can also travel in other ways, such as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>through yards</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>along tracks or roads</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>via field drains</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To assess the risk of runoff and soil erosion, you can consider:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>the gradient of a slope - steeper slopes have a greater risk of runoff and soil erosion as water runs more quickly over the surface</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>how long a slope is</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>soil texture - this affects whether rain soaks into the soil or runs over the surface, and how easily soil particles will be washed away</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>how often the land floods - it is more susceptible to erosion and runoff if it floods frequently</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>how close the land is to a water body</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1a-assess-the-gradient-of-the-slope-1">Step 1a: Assess the gradient of the slope</h4>

<p>You can choose how to measure the gradient of a slope. For example, you could use a clinometer.</p>

<p>The risk of runoff is:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>high for steep slopes - these are slopes with an angle of 7 degrees or more (12%+ gradient)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>moderate for moderate slopes - slopes with an angle of 3-7 degrees (5-12% gradient)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>lower for gentle slopes - slopes with an angle of 2-3 degrees (3-5% gradient)</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1b-assess-other-runoff-and-erosion-factors-1">Step 1b: Assess other runoff and erosion factors</h4>

<p>After you’ve assessed the risk of runoff for each land parcel based on the gradient of the slope, you can adjust the runoff and erosion risk assessment to reflect:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>slope length</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>soil texture</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>flooding frequency</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>history of runoff or ponding</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, lighter soils on moderate slopes have a high risk of runoff. Land that regularly floods (at least once every 3 years) has a high risk of erosion or runoff.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1c-assess-how-close-land-is-to-water-1">Step 1c: Assess how close land is to water</h4>

<p>The risk of runoff may be less significant if the land parcel is not close or well connected to a water body, such as a pond, lake, ditch, stream or river. You can assess the risk of runoff based on how close the land parcel is to a water body.</p>

<p>The risk of runoff is:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>high – if the land parcel you’re assessing is directly next to a water body</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>moderate – if the land parcel is separated from a water body by at least one other land parcel</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>lower – if the land parcel is some distance for land from a water body</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1d-risk-based-on-history-of-runoff-or-ponding-1">Step 1d: risk based on history of runoff or ponding</h4>

<p>You can then refine the risk assessment for each land parcel based on the history of runoff and ponding. The risk of runoff is:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>high - if visible runoff and ponding happens to the land you’re assessing in most years during wet periods</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>moderate - if visible runoff happens in most years during wet periods</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>lower - if runoff happens occasionally during wet periods</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1e-refine-your-risk-of-runoff-and-soil-erosion-1">Step 1e: refine your risk of runoff and soil erosion</h4>

<p>Once you’ve considered the risks above, you can use your experience and judgement to adjust the level of risk for each land parcel, taking into account additional factors such as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>soil structure</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>organic matter content - higher organic content usually increases the ability of soil to absorb water</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>valley features, as they tend to concentrate runoff water</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>long unbroken slopes</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>land use</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-2-risk-of-wind-erosion-1">Step 2: Risk of wind erosion</h4>

<p>Wind erosion is most likely on fine sandy soils and light peaty soils. It will be worse in dry conditions or where there is drainage, bare land or fine dry seedbeds.</p>

<p>Signs of wind erosion include drifting soil, buried seedlings, and soil blown into hedgerows, ditches and onto nearby roads.</p>

<p>If there are fine sandy soils or light peaty soils and wind erosion occurs at least once every 3 years, identify this area as high risk in your soil assessment. If there are chalk or limestone soils, the risk is likely to be moderate. Other soil types are likely to be lower risk.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-3-risk-of-nitrogen-leaching-1">Step 3: Risk of nitrogen leaching</h4>

<p>Light sandy and shallow soils are less able to store nitrogen. It can be easily lost as water filters through the soil. If you have land parcels with this type of soil where you add nitrogen-based fertilisers, identify this as being at risk of nitrogen leaching.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-4-make-an-overall-risk-assessment-1">Step 4: Make an overall risk assessment</h4>

<p>Once you’ve assessed all the risks above, and made any adjustments you judge are relevant, you can make your overall risk assessment for your land. You can do this by classifying the overall risks as very high, high, moderate or lower. For example:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>if there are a number of high risks, it’s likely to be an overall very high risk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>if there are some high risks, some mediums and a few lower risks, it’s likely to be an overall high risk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>if there are mainly medium and lower risks, it’s likely to be an overall medium risk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>If there are mainly lower risks, it’s likely to be an overall lower risk</p>
    </li>
</ul>

    <span class="number">18.4 </span>Action 2: Test soil organic matter</h3>

<p id="test-som">Testing soil organic matter will help you assess the health of your soil. To do this, you can:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>take soil samples</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>analyse the soil samples, which will usually be done by a commercial laboratory</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-select-a-sample-area-1">How to select a sample area</h4>

<p>Before you take soil samples, you’ll need to select your sample areas. A sample area is an area of land across which you will take soil samples.</p>

<p>When you select sample areas, try to choose areas which have:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>a similar soil type</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>been managed in a similar way in the past</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If the soil type and past management is similar, you can take account of the size of the land parcels:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>select one sample area in each land parcel if you consider the land parcels to be an average size</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>select a number of smaller sample areas within a large land parcel</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>combine small land parcels into a single sample area, but try to avoid the combined area being too large as this will reduce the soil testing analysis accuracy</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The improved grassland soils standard requires that during your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, each land parcel has been tested for soil organic matter within the last 5 years. Make sure you meet this requirement of the standard if you combine a number of small land parcels into a single sample area. For example, the overall combined area could include samples from each land parcel.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-take-soil-samples-1">When to take soil samples</h4>

<p>You may find it easier to take soil samples in the spring or autumn, before you cultivate the land. This will also avoid damaging the crop.</p>

<p>It is advisable to avoid taking soil samples if:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>the soil is waterlogged or very dry, because it may reduce the quality of the soil analysis</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>manure or slurry has been applied within around the last 3 months, as it may affect the soil organic matter levels and give you a false result</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-take-soil-samples-1">How to take soil samples</h4>

<p>You can take multiple soil samples on each sample area and combine them into a single sample that represents the soil across each sample area.</p>

<p>You can choose how many soil samples you take in each sample area, but try to take enough to gain a good understanding of the soil organic matter across each sample area.</p>

<p>Avoid taking soil samples on areas of land where:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>there are historical or archaeological features, as identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>features like manure heaps, pylons, gateways, headlands and around trees, as these features can distort the soil analysis results</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To get a representative sample of the sample area you’re testing, aim to take cores up to a depth of around 15cm (6 inches).</p>

<p>You can follow these steps to take soil samples for soil organic matter:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Walk a ‘W’ pattern across the sample area, with 5-7 stops along each leg of the ‘W’.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>This will give you around 25 soil samples across the sample area.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Combine the soil samples in a clean plastic bag, to form one bulk sample of about 0.5kg.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to assess the soil structure and soil biology (for action 1), at 5 to 10 stops across the whole ‘W’ you can:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>assess topsoil structure</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>count and record earthworms</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can also assess the subsoil structure at 3 of the stops, one of which should be on a headland.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the AHDB guidance about <a rel="external" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/how-to-collect-a-soil-sample" class="govuk-link">how to collect a soil sample</a>.</p>

<p>The image below shows how you can walk a ‘W’ and take soil samples across a sample area.</p>

</figure>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-test-the-soil-samples-1">How to test the soil samples</h4>

<p>If you have the right equipment and expertise, you can test the soil samples yourself. However, sending your soil samples to a commercial laboratory will usually give more accurate results. You can find a list of&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/soil-and-forage-testing-companies" class="govuk-link">laboratories where you can send your soil samples</a> on the AHDB website.</p>

<p>Try to use the same laboratory and method of testing if you are repeating the tests over a number of years. Having a consistent approach will help you see how the soil organic matter is increasing or decreasing over time.</p>

<p>If you use a laboratory, you can ask them to test organic matter content by using the:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>loss on ignition test (as a minimum level of analysis)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Dumas test, which uses dry combustion to burn the samples</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-minimise-bare-ground-over-winter">How to minimise bare ground over winter</h4>

<p>There are various ways you can minimise bare ground, including:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>ensuring early establishment of reseeded grassland</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>preventing livestock poaching wet ground</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>avoiding localised poaching around gateways and when supplementary feeding livestock</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-ensure-early-establishment-of-reseeded-grassland">How to ensure early establishment of reseeded grassland</h4>

<p>To ensure early establishment of reseeded grassland, you can cultivate the land parcel in the spring and summer rather than autumn.</p>

<p>Reseeding grassland in the spring will usually mean there are better conditions for the grass to establish, with sufficient soil moisture to support germination of the grass seeds.</p>

<p>Before reseeding, you may choose to address any subsoil compaction or surface capping.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the AHDB’s guidance about <a rel="external" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/grassland-reseeding" class="govuk-link">grassland reseeding</a>.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-prevent-livestock-poaching-wet-ground">How to prevent livestock poaching wet ground</h4>

<p>To prevent livestock poaching wet ground, you can move them regularly or reduce the number of livestock grazing an area of land.</p>

<p>You can also:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>have a dense sward to protect the soil and minimise the formation of bare patches</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>provide hard standing around permanent feeders, water troughs and in gateways regularly used by livestock</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-avoid-localised-poaching">How to avoid localised poaching</h4>

<p>You can move supplementary feeders and water troughs regularly to avoid localised poaching by livestock. If there are historic features identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>, you can try to supplementary feed at least 6m away from those features, where possible.</p>

<p>You can also try to make sure that farm vehicles use established tracks.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="action-4-establish-or-maintain-herbal-leys-1">
    <span class="number">18.6 </span>Action 4: Establish or maintain herbal leys</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-establish-herbal-leys">How to establish herbal leys</h4>

<p>The correct seed mix is vital to growing a high-quality herbal ley. Your seed supplier can help you choose a seed mix that is the best match for our land, local conditions and how you’ll manage the ley.</p>

<p>You can choose what mix of grasses, legumes and herbs to use in the herbal ley. A high-quality herbal ley will usually include at least:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>5 species of grass, such as cocksfoot, festulolium, meadow fescue, perennial ryegrass, smooth-stalked meadow grass, tall fescue and timothy)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>3 species of legumes, such as bird’s-foot-trefoil, lucerne, red clover, sainfoin winter vetch and common vetch, and black medick</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>5 species of herbs, such as burnet, chicory, ribwort plantain and yarrow</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid festulolium and perennial ryegrass combined making up more than 70% by weight of the total seed mix.</p>

<p>The improved grassland soils standard requires that you don’t establish herbal leys on any area that is a site of special scientific interest, or historic or archaeological features identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-maintain-herbal-leys">How to maintain herbal leys</h4>

<p>You can maintain herbal leys by:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>grazing</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>cutting</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Between the start of May and the end of July, you can rest the herbal leys from cutting and grazing for a period of at least 5 weeks. This allows the flowers to open and provide a source of pollen and nectar for insects.</p>

<p>It can take up to 4 years for the roots to grow enough to improve soil structure and fertility.</p>

<p id="how-to-moorland">This ‘How to’ guide gives advice about how you could complete the actions in this standard.&nbsp;You may find it helpful to read this guide, but you don’t have to follow it.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-this-guide-covers">
    <span class="number">19.1 </span>What this guide covers</h3>

<p>This guide covers how to assess a wide range of moorland features, some of which will be relevant to the moorland you are surveying.&nbsp;This largely depends on what type of soil is present.</p>

<p>The main steps in assessing your moorland are summarised below.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1-select-your-sample-points">Step 1: Select your sample points</h4>

<p>Divide your moorland into around 10 hectare (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) blocks and select a sample point within each block.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-2-carry-out-the-survey-at-each-sample-point">Step 2: Carry out the survey at each sample point</h4>

<p>At each sample point, identify, assess the condition (where relevant) and:</p>

<p>For all soils, record:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>presence or non-presence of peat (and depth of peat if it is present)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>extent of bare ground</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>extent of erosion</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>roughness of ground surface</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>presence of historic and archaeological features</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>presence of additional features such as trees, scrub, bracken and artificial drainage</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have peat soils, also record:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>wetness of peat soil</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>presence of peat forming bog mosses</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>range of peatland plants</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have non-peat soils (or soils with minimal peat), also record:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>overall overage height of tall or woody vegetation</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>overall average height of tall or deep-rooted vegetation</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-3-assess-public-goods">Step 3: Assess public goods</h4>

<p>Use the information from Step 2 to assess the public goods already provided by the moorland.</p>

<p>Use the information from steps 2 and 3 to identify potential opportunities to improve the condition of the features to maintain or enhance delivery of the public goods provided by the moorland.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-to-prepare-to-do-the-survey-of-the-moorland">
    <span class="number">19.2 </span>How to prepare to do the survey of the moorland</h3>

<p>The best time to survey moorland is between mid-July and the end of October. This avoids the main bird breeding season (March to mid-July).</p>

<p>Birds, nests and eggs are protected by law. If you see signs of nesting birds, you should delay the survey until the birds fledge.</p>

<p>Try to avoid doing the survey after periods of heavy or prolonged rainfall.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="step-1-select-your-sample-points-1">
    <span class="number">19.3 </span>Step 1: Select your sample points</h3>

<p>Before you survey the moorland, the moorland standard requires that you divide the moorland area into blocks of around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> and select a sample point within each block.</p>

<p>At each sample point:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>identify, assess and record the soil, vegetation and historic and archaeological features (action 1 of the introductory level of the moorland standard)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>identify public goods the moorland is already providing (action 2)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>identify opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods your moorland provides (action 3)</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To select your sample points, you may find it helpful to use a paper or digital Ordnance Survey (OS) map of either:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>1:10,000 scale</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>1:25,000 scale, which shows contours</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can overlay the OS map with a grid to split the moorland into blocks of around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> (for example 200m x 500m rectangular blocks). If possible, try to make the blocks equally-sized.</p>

<p>The moorland standard requires that each 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block is surveyed at a different sample point each year of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. You can therefore consider:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>splitting the 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> blocks into 3 smaller areas</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>selecting a sample point within each of the 3 smaller areas that broadly represents the main vegetation and soil types within the 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>numbering each sample point on the OS map, to help you identify where your observations were taken</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Select sample points that you can access safely to complete the survey.</p>

<p>The image below shows an OS map divided into around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> blocks, and a plan for how to assess each block over a three year period.</p>

<p>In your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, you will be told if you need to request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>). To prepare for the survey, you can use the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> map to identify historic and archaeological features on your OS map.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="step-2-carry-out-the-survey-at-each-sample-point-1">
    <span class="number">19.4 </span>Step 2: Carry out the survey at each sample point</h3>

<p>You can keep a record of your survey on paper or digitally. You may also find it helpful to have a camera with you to take photographs.</p>

<p>At each sample point, take a short walk around it to confirm the main vegetation and soil types broadly represent the surrounding area.</p>

<p>You should choose a different sample point if the:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>main vegetation and soil types are not broadly representative</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>selected sample point is not safe to survey</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If the whole 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block is unsafe to survey, record that it was unsafe and move to the next 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block.</p>

<p>At each sample point, record the unique number you have given it and identify, assess and record the information required.</p>

<p>You may choose to take photographs at each sample point of:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>the vegetation at your feet</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>the surrounding area, including historic and archaeological features</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-to-survey-at-each-sample-point">What to survey at each sample point</h4>

<p>At each sample point, the moorland standard requires that you identify, assess and record the soil, vegetation and historic and archaeological features. This will help you assess the:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>public goods these are providing</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods provided</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The environmental public goods provided by moorland include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>carbon storage and capture, to offset the effects of climate change</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>water storage and flow, to reduce the effects of flooding and drought</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>clean water, to maintain or enhance water quality</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>biodiversity, to protect plants and wildlife</p>
    </li>
    <li>

<p>There may be some additional features around the sample point that could affect the public goods the moorland provides. It may be helpful to record these as part of your survey. They include trees and scrub, bracken, drains and gullies and rock and scree.</p>

    <span class="number">19.5 </span>Step 2(a): How to survey the features relevant to all soil types</h3>

<p>At each sample point, you can survey the following features on both peat and non-peat soils.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="presence-and-depth-of-peat">Presence and depth of peat</h4>

<p>You can use a thin rod or cane to assess the presence of peat and measure its depth. It would be helpful to mark it with 5cm, 10cm, 25cm, 30cm and 40cm from its base.</p>

<p>You can use the thin rod or cane to probe the soil for the presence of peat, and its depth. Push it vertically into the soil until you feel resistance or to a depth of more than 40cm.</p>

<p>You can record the soil type as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>non-peat - if the thin rod or cane meets resistance at a depth of less than 5cm</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>shallow peat if the thin rod or cane meets resistance at a depth of between 5-40cm</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>deep peat - if the thin rod or cane meets resistance at a depth of over 40cm</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If there is existing data available on presence of peat and its depth, this can be used as an alternative to probing the soil.</p>

<p>You should avoid probing the soil on areas where there are historical or archaeological features.&nbsp;Your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will help you identify such areas.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="extent-of-bare-ground">Extent of bare ground</h4>

<p>Bare ground is prone to erosion and can emit CO2 to the atmosphere as organic matter decomposes. Minimal bare ground helps protect against this. You can assess the extent of bare ground by looking at the overall position across the sample point.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="extent-of-erosion">Extent of erosion</h4>

<p>Obvious signs of erosion include rills and gullies on exposed areas, particularly if they’re linked to water bodies.</p>

<p>Erosion features could include vehicle tracks and footpaths. These concentrate water flow, for example, on steep slopes.</p>

<p>You can assess the extent of erosion by looking at the overall position in the area around the sample point.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="structure-of-grassy-and-non-grassy-vegetation">Structure of grassy and non-grassy vegetation</h4>

<p>On non-peat soils, the structure of either grassy or non-grassy vegetation can affect how the moorland provides habitat for different species.</p>

<p>Depending on to the vegetation at your sample point, you can assess either:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>grassy vegetation, where there is over 75% grass or herb cover</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>non-grassy vegetation, where there is over 25% cover of dwarf shrubs, and it does not fit the description of grassy vegetation</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can use a thin rod or cane to assess the height of grassy or non-grassy vegetation. It would be helpful to mark it with 5cm, 10cm, 25cm, 30cm and 40cm from its base.</p>

<p>You may need to do this in a few places to give you an average across the sample point</p>
