    <span class="number">18.1 </span>Action 1: Complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</h3>

<p>To complete a soil assessment, you’ll usually need to:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>assess soil type, texture, structure and biology</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>assess risks to your soil</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>identify historic features</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Try to assess the soil and take soil samples when it is not too dry or wet. Spring or autumn are usually the best time of year to complete a soil assessment.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="assess-soil-type-structure-and-biology-1">Assess soil type, structure and biology</h4>

<p>The main soil types are:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>sand</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>silt</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>clay</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>loam</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>chalk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>peat</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out more about these soil types in the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) information about the <a rel="external" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/characteristics-different-soils" class="govuk-link">characteristics of different soils</a>.</p>

<p>To check the soil type, you can search for your location in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.landis.org.uk/soilscapes/" class="govuk-link">Soilscapes soil types viewer</a> produced by the National Soil Resources Institute of Cranfield University.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="soil-texture-1">Soil texture</h4>

<p>Soil texture depends on the mix of sand, silt and clay in the soil.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/32016?category=9001" class="govuk-link">read Natural England’s Technical Information Note about soil texture</a>, which includes the main soil texture types and what you’re likely to feel and see for each texture class.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="soil-structure-and-compaction-1">Soil structure and compaction</h4>

<p>Soil structure affects how air and water move in the soil and how well crops and grass can grow.</p>

<p>You can choose how you assess soil structure. To do this, you can:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>look at the soil surface to assess the quality of the crop or grass sward and identify areas where there may be soil structure issues</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>take a soil sample by digging out a block of soil to a depth of around 30cm (12 inches)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>score the soil sample by visually assessing it</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can read:</p>

</ul>

<p>It may save time if you assess soil structure when you <a href="#test-som" class="govuk-link">test soil organic matter</a>.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="soil-biology-1">Soil biology</h4>

<p>Soil biology includes the presence of earthworms and other visible creatures, soil organic matter and microorganisms.</p>

<p>You can use a soil sample to count earthworms and other visible creatures, such as millipedes and spiders. To do this, you can use the same soil samples taken to assess soil structure and soil organic matter (action 2) or dig another pit.</p>

<p>The soil organic matter testing you do under action 2 will tell you about the soil organic matter.</p>

<p>Microorganisms can be quite difficult to assess yourself, but if you’d like to find out more you can ask a commercial laboratory to test soil samples for this.</p>

<p>To find out more about soil biology, you can read the AHDB factsheet: <a rel="external" href="https://projectblue.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Imported%20Publication%20Docs/IntroSoiBiology_WEB2074_280219.pdf" class="govuk-link">An introduction to Soil Biology</a>.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="assess-risks-relating-to-soil-1">
    <span class="number">18.2 </span>Assess risks relating to soil</h3>

<p>You can assess the risks relating to soil from:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>runoff or soil erosion, including connection to water bodies or sensitive habitats</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>wind erosion</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>nitrogen leaching</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve assessed these risks you can make an overall assessment of the risk for your land.</p>

<p>You can follow the steps below to assess risks to your soil.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1-risk-of-runoff-and-soil-erosion-1">Step 1: Risk of runoff and soil erosion</h4>

<p>Runoff occurs when there is more water than land can absorb, meaning that water drains away directly over the surface of land. This can carry fine soil particles, nutrients, pesticides and manures to water bodies, such as ponds, lakes, ditches, stream and rivers. This can cause pollution and potentially harm animals and plants that live in the water bodies.</p>

<p>Runoff can wash material directly from a land parcel into a water body. It can also travel in other ways, such as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>through yards</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>along tracks or roads</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>via field drains</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To assess the risk of runoff and soil erosion, you can consider:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>the gradient of a slope - steeper slopes have a greater risk of runoff and soil erosion as water runs more quickly over the surface</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>how long a slope is</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>soil texture - this affects whether rain soaks into the soil or runs over the surface, and how easily soil particles will be washed away</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>how often the land floods - it is more susceptible to erosion and runoff if it floods frequently</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>how close the land is to a water body</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1a-assess-the-gradient-of-the-slope-1">Step 1a: Assess the gradient of the slope</h4>

<p>You can choose how to measure the gradient of a slope. For example, you could use a clinometer.</p>

<p>The risk of runoff is:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>high for steep slopes - these are slopes with an angle of 7 degrees or more (12%+ gradient)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>moderate for moderate slopes - slopes with an angle of 3-7 degrees (5-12% gradient)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>lower for gentle slopes - slopes with an angle of 2-3 degrees (3-5% gradient)</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1b-assess-other-runoff-and-erosion-factors-1">Step 1b: Assess other runoff and erosion factors</h4>

<p>After you’ve assessed the risk of runoff for each land parcel based on the gradient of the slope, you can adjust the runoff and erosion risk assessment to reflect:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>slope length</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>soil texture</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>flooding frequency</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>history of runoff or ponding</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, lighter soils on moderate slopes have a high risk of runoff. Land that regularly floods (at least once every 3 years) has a high risk of erosion or runoff.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1c-assess-how-close-land-is-to-water-1">Step 1c: Assess how close land is to water</h4>

<p>The risk of runoff may be less significant if the land parcel is not close or well connected to a water body, such as a pond, lake, ditch, stream or river. You can assess the risk of runoff based on how close the land parcel is to a water body.</p>

<p>The risk of runoff is:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>high – if the land parcel you’re assessing is directly next to a water body</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>moderate – if the land parcel is separated from a water body by at least one other land parcel</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>lower – if the land parcel is some distance for land from a water body</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1d-risk-based-on-history-of-runoff-or-ponding-1">Step 1d: risk based on history of runoff or ponding</h4>

<p>You can then refine the risk assessment for each land parcel based on the history of runoff and ponding. The risk of runoff is:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>high - if visible runoff and ponding happens to the land you’re assessing in most years during wet periods</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>moderate - if visible runoff happens in most years during wet periods</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>lower - if runoff happens occasionally during wet periods</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1e-refine-your-risk-of-runoff-and-soil-erosion-1">Step 1e: refine your risk of runoff and soil erosion</h4>

<p>Once you’ve considered the risks above, you can use your experience and judgement to adjust the level of risk for each land parcel, taking into account additional factors such as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>soil structure</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>organic matter content - higher organic content usually increases the ability of soil to absorb water</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>valley features, as they tend to concentrate runoff water</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>long unbroken slopes</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>land use</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-2-risk-of-wind-erosion-1">Step 2: Risk of wind erosion</h4>

<p>Wind erosion is most likely on fine sandy soils and light peaty soils. It will be worse in dry conditions or where there is drainage, bare land or fine dry seedbeds.</p>

<p>Signs of wind erosion include drifting soil, buried seedlings, and soil blown into hedgerows, ditches and onto nearby roads.</p>

<p>If there are fine sandy soils or light peaty soils and wind erosion occurs at least once every 3 years, identify this area as high risk in your soil assessment. If there are chalk or limestone soils, the risk is likely to be moderate. Other soil types are likely to be lower risk.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-3-risk-of-nitrogen-leaching-1">Step 3: Risk of nitrogen leaching</h4>

<p>Light sandy and shallow soils are less able to store nitrogen. It can be easily lost as water filters through the soil. If you have land parcels with this type of soil where you add nitrogen-based fertilisers, identify this as being at risk of nitrogen leaching.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-4-make-an-overall-risk-assessment-1">Step 4: Make an overall risk assessment</h4>

<p>Once you’ve assessed all the risks above, and made any adjustments you judge are relevant, you can make your overall risk assessment for your land. You can do this by classifying the overall risks as very high, high, moderate or lower. For example:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>if there are a number of high risks, it’s likely to be an overall very high risk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>if there are some high risks, some mediums and a few lower risks, it’s likely to be an overall high risk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>if there are mainly medium and lower risks, it’s likely to be an overall medium risk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>If there are mainly lower risks, it’s likely to be an overall lower risk</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-to-produce-a-soil-management-plan-1">
    <span class="number">18.3 </span>How to produce a soil management plan</h3>

<p>You can use your soil assessment to record information in your soil management plan. This will help you plan how to manage your land parcels to improve soil health and reduce the risks you identified in your soil assessment.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="information-you-can-record-in-the-soil-management-plan-1">Information you can record in the soil management plan</h4>

<p>You can record information in your plan for each land parcel or area where the soils and slopes differ, as identified during your soil assessment. The information you record in your soil management plan could include:</p>

    <span class="number">18.4 </span>Action 2: Test soil organic matter</h3>

<p id="test-som">Testing soil organic matter will help you assess the health of your soil. To do this, you can:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>take soil samples</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>analyse the soil samples, which will usually be done by a commercial laboratory</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-select-a-sample-area-1">How to select a sample area</h4>

<p>Before you take soil samples, you’ll need to select your sample areas. A sample area is an area of land across which you will take soil samples.</p>

<p>When you select sample areas, try to choose areas which have:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>a similar soil type</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>been managed in a similar way in the past</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If the soil type and past management is similar, you can take account of the size of the land parcels:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>select one sample area in each land parcel if you consider the land parcels to be an average size</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>select a number of smaller sample areas within a large land parcel</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>combine small land parcels into a single sample area, but try to avoid the combined area being too large as this will reduce the soil testing analysis accuracy</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The improved grassland soils standard requires that during your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, each land parcel has been tested for soil organic matter within the last 5 years. Make sure you meet this requirement of the standard if you combine a number of small land parcels into a single sample area. For example, the overall combined area could include samples from each land parcel.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-take-soil-samples-1">When to take soil samples</h4>

<p>You may find it easier to take soil samples in the spring or autumn, before you cultivate the land. This will also avoid damaging the crop.</p>

<p>It is advisable to avoid taking soil samples if:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>the soil is waterlogged or very dry, because it may reduce the quality of the soil analysis</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>manure or slurry has been applied within around the last 3 months, as it may affect the soil organic matter levels and give you a false result</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-take-soil-samples-1">How to take soil samples</h4>

<p>You can take multiple soil samples on each sample area and combine them into a single sample that represents the soil across each sample area.</p>

<p>You can choose how many soil samples you take in each sample area, but try to take enough to gain a good understanding of the soil organic matter across each sample area.</p>

<p>Avoid taking soil samples on areas of land where:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>there are historical or archaeological features, as identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>features like manure heaps, pylons, gateways, headlands and around trees, as these features can distort the soil analysis results</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To get a representative sample of the sample area you’re testing, aim to take cores up to a depth of around 15cm (6 inches).</p>

<p>You can follow these steps to take soil samples for soil organic matter:</p>

    <li>
        <p>Walk a ‘W’ pattern across the sample area, with 5-7 stops along each leg of the ‘W’.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>This will give you around 25 soil samples across the sample area.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Combine the soil samples in a clean plastic bag, to form one bulk sample of about 0.5kg.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to assess the soil structure and soil biology (for action 1), at 5 to 10 stops across the whole ‘W’ you can:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>assess topsoil structure</p>
    </li>
    <li>

</ul>

<p>You can also assess the subsoil structure at 3 of the stops, one of which should be on a headland.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-test-the-soil-samples-1">How to test the soil samples</h4>

<p>If you have the right equipment and expertise, you can test the soil samples yourself. However, sending your soil samples to a commercial laboratory will usually give more accurate results. You can find a list of&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/soil-and-forage-testing-companies" class="govuk-link">laboratories where you can send your soil samples</a> on the AHDB website.</p>

<p>Try to use the same laboratory and method of testing if you are repeating the tests over a number of years. Having a consistent approach will help you see how the soil organic matter is increasing or decreasing over time.</p>

<p>If you use a laboratory, you can ask them to test organic matter content by using the:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>loss on ignition test (as a minimum level of analysis)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Dumas test, which uses dry combustion to burn the samples</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-minimise-bare-ground-over-winter">How to minimise bare ground over winter</h4>

<p>There are various ways you can minimise bare ground, including:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>ensuring early establishment of reseeded grassland</p>
    </li>

    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-ensure-early-establishment-of-reseeded-grassland">How to ensure early establishment of reseeded grassland</h4>

<p>To ensure early establishment of reseeded grassland, you can cultivate the land parcel in the spring and summer rather than autumn.</p>

<p>Reseeding grassland in the spring will usually mean there are better conditions for the grass to establish, with sufficient soil moisture to support germination of the grass seeds.</p>

<p>Before reseeding, you may choose to address any subsoil compaction or surface capping.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the AHDB’s guidance about <a rel="external" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/grassland-reseeding" class="govuk-link">grassland reseeding</a>.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-prevent-livestock-poaching-wet-ground">How to prevent livestock poaching wet ground</h4>

<p>To prevent livestock poaching wet ground, you can move them regularly or reduce the number of livestock grazing an area of land.</p>

<p>You can also:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>have a dense sward to protect the soil and minimise the formation of bare patches</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>provide hard standing around permanent feeders, water troughs and in gateways regularly used by livestock</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-avoid-localised-poaching">How to avoid localised poaching</h4>

<p>You can move supplementary feeders and water troughs regularly to avoid localised poaching by livestock. If there are historic features identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>, you can try to supplementary feed at least 6m away from those features, where possible.</p>

<p>You can also try to make sure that farm vehicles use established tracks.</p>

    <span class="number">18.6 </span>Action 4: Establish or maintain herbal leys</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-establish-herbal-leys">How to establish herbal leys</h4>

<p>The correct seed mix is vital to growing a high-quality herbal ley. Your seed supplier can help you choose a seed mix that is the best match for our land, local conditions and how you’ll manage the ley.</p>

<p>You can choose what mix of grasses, legumes and herbs to use in the herbal ley. A high-quality herbal ley will usually include at least:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>5 species of grass, such as cocksfoot, festulolium, meadow fescue, perennial ryegrass, smooth-stalked meadow grass, tall fescue and timothy)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>3 species of legumes, such as bird’s-foot-trefoil, lucerne, red clover, sainfoin winter vetch and common vetch, and black medick</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>5 species of herbs, such as burnet, chicory, ribwort plantain and yarrow</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid festulolium and perennial ryegrass combined making up more than 70% by weight of the total seed mix.</p>

<p>The improved grassland soils standard requires that you don’t establish herbal leys on any area that is a site of special scientific interest, or historic or archaeological features identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-maintain-herbal-leys">How to maintain herbal leys</h4>

<p>You can maintain herbal leys by:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>grazing</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>cutting</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Between the start of May and the end of July, you can rest the herbal leys from cutting and grazing for a period of at least 5 weeks. This allows the flowers to open and provide a source of pollen and nectar for insects.</p>

<p>It can take up to 4 years for the roots to grow enough to improve soil structure and fertility.</p>

<p id="how-to-moorland">This ‘How to’ guide gives advice about how you could complete the actions in this standard.&nbsp;You may find it helpful to read this guide, but you don’t have to follow it.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-this-guide-covers">
    <span class="number">19.1 </span>What this guide covers</h3>

<p>This guide covers how to assess a wide range of moorland features, some of which will be relevant to the moorland you are surveying.&nbsp;This largely depends on what type of soil is present.</p>

<p>The main steps in assessing your moorland are summarised below.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1-select-your-sample-points">Step 1: Select your sample points</h4>

<p>Divide your moorland into around 10 hectare (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) blocks and select a sample point within each block.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-2-carry-out-the-survey-at-each-sample-point">Step 2: Carry out the survey at each sample point</h4>

<p>At each sample point, identify, assess the condition (where relevant) and:</p>

<p>For all soils, record:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>presence or non-presence of peat (and depth of peat if it is present)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>extent of bare ground</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>extent of erosion</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>roughness of ground surface</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>presence of historic and archaeological features</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>presence of additional features such as trees, scrub, bracken and artificial drainage</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have peat soils, also record:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>wetness of peat soil</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>presence of peat forming bog mosses</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>range of peatland plants</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have non-peat soils (or soils with minimal peat), also record:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>overall overage height of tall or woody vegetation</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>overall average height of tall or deep-rooted vegetation</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-3-assess-public-goods">Step 3: Assess public goods</h4>

<p>Use the information from Step 2 to assess the public goods already provided by the moorland.</p>

<p>Use the information from steps 2 and 3 to identify potential opportunities to improve the condition of the features to maintain or enhance delivery of the public goods provided by the moorland.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-to-prepare-to-do-the-survey-of-the-moorland">
    <span class="number">19.2 </span>How to prepare to do the survey of the moorland</h3>

<p>The best time to survey moorland is between mid-July and the end of October. This avoids the main bird breeding season (March to mid-July).</p>

<p>Birds, nests and eggs are protected by law. If you see signs of nesting birds, you should delay the survey until the birds fledge.</p>

<p>Try to avoid doing the survey after periods of heavy or prolonged rainfall.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="step-1-select-your-sample-points-1">
    <span class="number">19.3 </span>Step 1: Select your sample points</h3>

<p>Before you survey the moorland, the moorland standard requires that you divide the moorland area into blocks of around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> and select a sample point within each block.</p>

<p>At each sample point:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>identify, assess and record the soil, vegetation and historic and archaeological features (action 1 of the introductory level of the moorland standard)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>identify public goods the moorland is already providing (action 2)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>identify opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods your moorland provides (action 3)</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To select your sample points, you may find it helpful to use a paper or digital Ordnance Survey (OS) map of either:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>1:10,000 scale</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>1:25,000 scale, which shows contours</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can overlay the OS map with a grid to split the moorland into blocks of around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> (for example 200m x 500m rectangular blocks). If possible, try to make the blocks equally-sized.</p>

<p>The moorland standard requires that each 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block is surveyed at a different sample point each year of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. You can therefore consider:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>splitting the 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> blocks into 3 smaller areas</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>selecting a sample point within each of the 3 smaller areas that broadly represents the main vegetation and soil types within the 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>numbering each sample point on the OS map, to help you identify where your observations were taken</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Select sample points that you can access safely to complete the survey.</p>

<p>The image below shows an OS map divided into around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> blocks, and a plan for how to assess each block over a three year period.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="other-information-to-help-you-prepare-for-the-survey">Other information to help you prepare for the survey</h4>

<p>In your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, you will be told if you need to request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>). To prepare for the survey, you can use the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> map to identify historic and archaeological features on your OS map.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="step-2-carry-out-the-survey-at-each-sample-point-1">
    <span class="number">19.4 </span>Step 2: Carry out the survey at each sample point</h3>

<p>You can keep a record of your survey on paper or digitally. You may also find it helpful to have a camera with you to take photographs.</p>

<p>At each sample point, take a short walk around it to confirm the main vegetation and soil types broadly represent the surrounding area.</p>

<p>You should choose a different sample point if the:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>main vegetation and soil types are not broadly representative</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>selected sample point is not safe to survey</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If the whole 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block is unsafe to survey, record that it was unsafe and move to the next 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block.</p>

<p>At each sample point, record the unique number you have given it and identify, assess and record the information required.</p>

<p>You may choose to take photographs at each sample point of:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>the vegetation at your feet</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>the surrounding area, including historic and archaeological features</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-to-survey-at-each-sample-point">What to survey at each sample point</h4>

<p>At each sample point, the moorland standard requires that you identify, assess and record the soil, vegetation and historic and archaeological features. This will help you assess the:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>public goods these are providing</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods provided</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The environmental public goods provided by moorland include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>carbon storage and capture, to offset the effects of climate change</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>water storage and flow, to reduce the effects of flooding and drought</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>clean water, to maintain or enhance water quality</p>
    </li>
    <li>

<p>You can use a thin rod or cane to assess the presence of peat and measure its depth. It would be helpful to mark it with 5cm, 10cm, 25cm, 30cm and 40cm from its base.</p>

<p>You can use the thin rod or cane to probe the soil for the presence of peat, and its depth. Push it vertically into the soil until you feel resistance or to a depth of more than 40cm.</p>

<p>You can record the soil type as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>non-peat - if the thin rod or cane meets resistance at a depth of less than 5cm</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>shallow peat if the thin rod or cane meets resistance at a depth of between 5-40cm</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>deep peat - if the thin rod or cane meets resistance at a depth of over 40cm</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If there is existing data available on presence of peat and its depth, this can be used as an alternative to probing the soil.</p>

<p>You should avoid probing the soil on areas where there are historical or archaeological features.&nbsp;Your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will help you identify such areas.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="extent-of-bare-ground">Extent of bare ground</h4>

<p>Bare ground is prone to erosion and can emit CO2 to the atmosphere as organic matter decomposes. Minimal bare ground helps protect against this. You can assess the extent of bare ground by looking at the overall position across the sample point.</p>

<p>You can use your survey results to help you identify what potential opportunities there are to maintain or change current management practices to keep providing or enhance provision of public goods.</p>

<p>Tables 13, 14 and 15 suggest potential opportunities for all soil types, peat soils and non-peat soils.</p>

<p>The introductory level of the moorland standard does not require you undertake such actions. At this stage you are just considering what management practices could be done in the future.</p>
