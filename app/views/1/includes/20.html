<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-this-guide-covers">
    <span class="number">19.1 </span>What this guide covers</h3>

<p>This guide covers how to assess a wide range of moorland features, some of which will be relevant to the moorland you are surveying.&nbsp;This largely depends on what type of soil is present.</p>

<p>The main steps in assessing your moorland are summarised below.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-1-select-your-sample-points">Step 1: Select your sample points</h4>

<p>Divide your moorland into around 10 hectare (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) blocks and select a sample point within each block.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-2-carry-out-the-survey-at-each-sample-point">Step 2: Carry out the survey at each sample point</h4>

<p>At each sample point, identify, assess the condition (where relevant) and:</p>

<p>For all soils, record:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>presence or non-presence of peat (and depth of peat if it is present)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>extent of bare ground</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>extent of erosion</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>roughness of ground surface</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>presence of historic and archaeological features</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>presence of additional features such as trees, scrub, bracken and artificial drainage</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have peat soils, also record:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>wetness of peat soil</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>presence of peat forming bog mosses</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>range of peatland plants</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have non-peat soils (or soils with minimal peat), also record:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>overall overage height of tall or woody vegetation</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>overall average height of tall or deep-rooted vegetation</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-3-assess-public-goods">Step 3: Assess public goods</h4>

<p>Use the information from Step 2 to assess the public goods already provided by the moorland.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="step-4-identify-potential-opportunities-to-maintain-or-enhance-the-public-goods-your-moorland-provides">Step 4: Identify potential opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods your moorland provides</h4>

<p>Use the information from steps 2 and 3 to identify potential opportunities to improve the condition of the features to maintain or enhance delivery of the public goods provided by the moorland.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-to-prepare-to-do-the-survey-of-the-moorland">
    <span class="number">19.2 </span>How to prepare to do the survey of the moorland</h3>

<p>The best time to survey moorland is between mid-July and the end of October. This avoids the main bird breeding season (March to mid-July).</p>

<p>Birds, nests and eggs are protected by law. If you see signs of nesting birds, you should delay the survey until the birds fledge.</p>

<p>Try to avoid doing the survey after periods of heavy or prolonged rainfall.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="step-1-select-your-sample-points-1">
    <span class="number">19.3 </span>Step 1: Select your sample points</h3>

<p>Before you survey the moorland, the moorland standard requires that you divide the moorland area into blocks of around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> and select a sample point within each block.</p>

<p>At each sample point:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>identify, assess and record the soil, vegetation and historic and archaeological features (action 1 of the introductory level of the moorland standard)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>identify public goods the moorland is already providing (action 2)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>identify opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods your moorland provides (action 3)</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To select your sample points, you may find it helpful to use a paper or digital Ordnance Survey (OS) map of either:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>1:10,000 scale</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>1:25,000 scale, which shows contours</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can overlay the OS map with a grid to split the moorland into blocks of around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> (for example 200m x 500m rectangular blocks). If possible, try to make the blocks equally-sized.</p>

<p>The moorland standard requires that each 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block is surveyed at a different sample point each year of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. You can therefore consider:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>splitting the 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> blocks into 3 smaller areas</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>selecting a sample point within each of the 3 smaller areas that broadly represents the main vegetation and soil types within the 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>numbering each sample point on the OS map, to help you identify where your observations were taken</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Select sample points that you can access safely to complete the survey.</p>

<p>The image below shows an OS map divided into around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> blocks, and a plan for how to assess each block over a three year period.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="other-information-to-help-you-prepare-for-the-survey">Other information to help you prepare for the survey</h4>

<p>In your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, you will be told if you need to request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>). To prepare for the survey, you can use the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> map to identify historic and archaeological features on your OS map.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="step-2-carry-out-the-survey-at-each-sample-point-1">
    <span class="number">19.4 </span>Step 2: Carry out the survey at each sample point</h3>

<p>You can keep a record of your survey on paper or digitally. You may also find it helpful to have a camera with you to take photographs.</p>

<p>At each sample point, take a short walk around it to confirm the main vegetation and soil types broadly represent the surrounding area.</p>

<p>You should choose a different sample point if the:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>main vegetation and soil types are not broadly representative</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>selected sample point is not safe to survey</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If the whole 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block is unsafe to survey, record that it was unsafe and move to the next 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block.</p>

<p>At each sample point, record the unique number you have given it and identify, assess and record the information required.</p>

<p>You may choose to take photographs at each sample point of:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>the vegetation at your feet</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>the surrounding area, including historic and archaeological features</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-to-survey-at-each-sample-point">What to survey at each sample point</h4>

<p>At each sample point, the moorland standard requires that you identify, assess and record the soil, vegetation and historic and archaeological features. This will help you assess the:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>public goods these are providing</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods provided</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The environmental public goods provided by moorland include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>carbon storage and capture, to offset the effects of climate change</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>water storage and flow, to reduce the effects of flooding and drought</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>clean water, to maintain or enhance water quality</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>biodiversity, to protect plants and wildlife</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>heritage, to protect historic and archaeological features</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>There may be some additional features around the sample point that could affect the public goods the moorland provides. It may be helpful to record these as part of your survey. They include trees and scrub, bracken, drains and gullies and rock and scree.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="step-2a-how-to-survey-the-features-relevant-to-all-soil-types">
    <span class="number">19.5 </span>Step 2(a): How to survey the features relevant to all soil types</h3>

<p>At each sample point, you can survey the following features on both peat and non-peat soils.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="presence-and-depth-of-peat">Presence and depth of peat</h4>

<p>You can use a thin rod or cane to assess the presence of peat and measure its depth. It would be helpful to mark it with 5cm, 10cm, 25cm, 30cm and 40cm from its base.</p>

<p>You can use the thin rod or cane to probe the soil for the presence of peat, and its depth. Push it vertically into the soil until you feel resistance or to a depth of more than 40cm.</p>

<p>You can record the soil type as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>non-peat - if the thin rod or cane meets resistance at a depth of less than 5cm</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>shallow peat if the thin rod or cane meets resistance at a depth of between 5-40cm</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>deep peat - if the thin rod or cane meets resistance at a depth of over 40cm</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If there is existing data available on presence of peat and its depth, this can be used as an alternative to probing the soil.</p>

<p>You should avoid probing the soil on areas where there are historical or archaeological features.&nbsp;Your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will help you identify such areas.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="extent-of-bare-ground">Extent of bare ground</h4>

<p>Bare ground is prone to erosion and can emit CO2 to the atmosphere as organic matter decomposes. Minimal bare ground helps protect against this. You can assess the extent of bare ground by looking at the overall position across the sample point.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="table-3-record-the-extent-of-bare-ground">Table 3: record the extent of bare ground</h4>

        </tr>
    </tbody>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="extent-of-erosion">Extent of erosion</h4>

<p>Obvious signs of erosion include rills and gullies on exposed areas, particularly if they’re linked to water bodies.</p>

<p>Erosion features could include vehicle tracks and footpaths. These concentrate water flow, for example, on steep slopes.</p>

<p>You can assess the extent of erosion by looking at the overall position in the area around the sample point.</p>

<p>There may be some additional features around the sample point that could affect the public goods the moorland provides. It may be helpful to record these as part of your survey. For example, you could record additional features within about 100 metres of each sample point.</p>

<p>These additional features include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
        <p>trees and scrub, which you can record as none, scattered trees/saplings and/or scrub, dense scrub, woodland or a mix of trees/scrub/woodland</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>bracken, which you can record as none, more than 50% canopy cover with some litter, more than 50% canopy cover with dense litter</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>drains and gullies, which you can record as none, channels mainly bare along base, channel base more than 50% vegetation, channel is blocked</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>rock and scree which you can record as none, rock outcrops e.g. crags and tors, scree and boulder fields, limestone pavement.</p>

    <span class="number">19.6 </span>Step 2(b): How to survey the features relevant to peat soils</h3>

<p>If you have identified peat soils, you can survey the following features.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="wetness-of-peat-soils">Wetness of peat soils</h4>

<p>The wetness affects the peat soil’s capacity to store carbon.</p>

<p>You can assess the wetness by a visual assessment and using the thin rod or cane you used to assess the presence and depth of peat.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="average-height-of-tall-or-woody-vegetation">Average height of tall or woody vegetation</h4>

<p>On non-peat soils, the presence of taller, woody vegetation contributes to carbon storage on the moorland. Tall, woody vegetation will usually be heather, other dwarf shrubs, gorse, other scrub and scattered trees.</p>

<p>You can use a thin rod or cane to assess the height of tall or woody vegetation. To do this, it would be helpful to mark it with 5cm, 10cm, 25cm, 30cm and 40cm from its base.</p>

<p>You may need to do this in a few places to give you an average across the sample point.</p>

<p>On non-peat soils, the structure of either grassy or non-grassy vegetation can affect how the moorland provides habitat for different species.</p>

<p>Depending on to the vegetation at your sample point, you can assess either:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

    <span class="number">19.8 </span>Step 4: Identify potential opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods your moorland provides</h3>

<p>You can use your survey results to help you identify what potential opportunities there are to maintain or change current management practices to keep providing or enhance provision of public goods.</p>

<p>Tables 13, 14 and 15 suggest potential opportunities for all soil types, peat soils and non-peat soils.</p>

<p>The introductory level of the moorland standard does not require you undertake such actions. At this stage you are just considering what management practices could be done in the future.</p>
