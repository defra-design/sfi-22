<p>This covers what you need to know to complete the actions in the improved grassland soils standard of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>).</p>

<p>You only have to meet a requirement in this standard if the word ‘must’ is used. In this case, it’s part of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The other information is to help you, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<p>You can understand what you’re agreeing to do by reading this information on the improved grassland soils standard, together with your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement document and its terms and conditions.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-the-improved-grassland-soils-standard-will-improve-the-environment">
    <span class="number">13.1 </span>How the improved grassland soils standard will improve the environment</h3>

<p>As soils are one of the most important natural assets, the improved grassland soils standard is focused on improving soil health, structure, organic matter, and biology. These improvements can benefit food production. They also contribute to a range of environmental and climate change outcomes, including better:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>water quality</li>
    <li>climate resilience</li>
    <li>biodiversity</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="eligible-land-for-the-improved-grassland-soils-standard">
    <span class="number">13.2 </span>Eligible land for the improved grassland soils standard</h3>

<p>You can only enter land into the improved grassland soils standard that:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>has an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
    <li>is an eligible ‘land type’</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="land-cover-3">Land cover</h4>

<p>Each land parcel has one or more registered land covers. These identify what broad category the land is.</p>

<p>You can view the land cover currently registered for each land parcel on your digital maps in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">Rural Payments service</a>. Read more information about <a href="#check-your-land-details" class="govuk-link">land cover and checking your digital maps before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The eligible land covers for the improved grassland soils standard are:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Arable Land (only if its land type is improved temporary grassland)</li>
    <li>Permanent Grassland (only if its land type is improved permanent grassland)</li>
    <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Drain/Ditch/Dyke on a boundary</li>
    <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Track – natural surface</li>
</ul>

<p>If a land parcel has one or more of these eligible land covers, it will show as ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. When you select this land parcel, its total available area is included in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. You cannot reduce it in your application.</p>

<p>A land parcel’s available area is only eligible for this standard if it is also an eligible land type.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="land-type-3">Land type</h4>

<p>The land type describes the detailed use of a land parcel’s broad category of land cover.</p>

<p>You can enter a land parcel into the improved grassland soils standard if its land type is improved grassland. This includes both permanent and temporary grassland, as long as it’s improved grassland. If there are drains, ditches, dykes or tracks with a natural surface in an otherwise improved grassland parcel, those can be viewed as part of that land parcel’s eligible land type area.</p>

<p>To qualify as improved grassland, the land will have been managed in some or all of the following ways:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>regular re-seeding, or has been reseeded within the last 15 years</li>
    <li>regular fertilising with typically at least 100 kg per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of nitrogen as an artificial compound fertiliser or animal manures and slurries</li>
    <li>boom spraying herbicide to treat weeds</li>
    <li>active, well-maintained field drains</li>
    <li>taking any conserved forage as silage, haylage or hay, usually more than once a year</li>
</ul>

<p>Improved grassland will usually have a high coverage of ryegrass and white clover.</p>

<p>Permanent grassland is land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage, which has not been included in the crop rotation for 5 or more consecutive years. It may have been reseeded during that time.</p>

<p>Temporary grassland is land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage for less than 5 consecutive years. You can choose to view this as either:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>improved grassland and enter it into the improved grassland soils standard</li>
    <li>arable land and enter it into the arable and horticultural soils standard</li>
</ul>

<p>Unimproved grassland is not eligible for this standard. Unimproved grassland means land that has not been cultivated within the last 15 years. For example, it will not have been cultivated during this 15-year period by:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>sowing or reseeding</li>
    <li>ploughing, or an activity that breaks the soil surface or disrupts the subsoil</li>
    <li>adding artificial fertiliser or soil improvers</li>
</ul>

<p>This unimproved grassland may be eligible for Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>) grassland options. A low and no input grassland standard should be available in <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> from 2024.</p>

<p>Unimproved grassland will usually have a diverse sward made up of a range of grasses and wildflowers.</p>

<p>If you have recently created a species rich sward, for example, under a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement, you cannot enter that area into this standard. Read the <a href="#how-an-sfi-standards-agreement-interacts-with-other-funding-schemes" class="govuk-link">interaction between <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> and other schemes</a> for more information.</p>

<p>In your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, the total available area of a land parcel must be improved grassland. If part of a land parcel’s available area includes an ineligible land type for this standard, you must not select that land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. It’s not possible for you to reduce the available area in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p>For example, you must not select a land parcel if its total available area is:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> based on its Permanent Grassland land cover, but only 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> is improved permanent grassland</li>
    <li>10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> based on its Arable land cover, but only 5 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> is improved temporary grassland</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="other-land-eligibility-issues-to-consider-2">
    <span class="number">13.3 </span>Other land eligibility issues to consider</h3>

<p>You should also consider the following land eligibility issues.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="land-in-another-agri-environment-scheme-agreement-2">Land in another agri-environment scheme agreement</h4>

<p>Land in an existing agri-environment scheme agreement, such as <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>, may also be eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-an-sfi-standards-agreement-interacts-with-other-funding-schemes" class="govuk-link">interaction between <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> and other schemes</a> for more information.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="scheduled-monuments-historic-and-archaeological-features-3">Scheduled monuments, historic and archaeological features</h4>

<p>If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you must request a Sustainable Farming Incentive Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will tell you about any known historic and archaeological features on your land, including scheduled monuments. It will also tell you how they affect the actions you can take under the standards.</p>

<p>You must not complete action 4 (establish or maintain herbal leys) in the improved grassland standard on any area with historic or archaeological features identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>. You’ll still be paid for this area entered into the standard.</p>

<p>To request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>, you need to register on the <a rel="external" href="https://hefer-data.org.uk/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> portal</a>. The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will be available before applications open. Once registered, you can request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> by entering your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>). You will then be sent an email when the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> is available for you to download.</p>

<p>Before you enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, read more about:</p>

</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="sites-of-special-scientific-interest-sssis-2">Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)</h4>

<p><abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is eligible for the introductory and intermediate levels of the improved grassland soils standard. However, you must not complete action 4 (establish and maintain herbal leys) on <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land.</p>

<p>While it is unlikely that the other actions under the introductory and intermediate levels of the improved grassland soils standard will be listed operations requiring Natural England consent, it is your responsibility to check.</p>

<p>If you intend to complete the other actions by carrying out a listed operation within the boundary of the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>, you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi" class="govuk-link">give notice to Natural England and get its consent</a> before you carry out any listed operations on the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land.</p>

<p>You can find the listed operations requiring Natural England consent on your <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land by searching for the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> on the <a rel="external" href="https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx" class="govuk-link">designated sites system</a>.

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="peaty-soil-1">Peaty soil</h4>

<p>Land with ‘peaty soil’ is eligible for this standard. Peaty soil means there is around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more.</p>

<p>You should not complete action 4 (establish or maintain herbal leys ) of this standard on land with peaty soil as explained below. You’ll still be paid for this area, even if you do not complete action 4. This is a temporary measure until specific measures on the sustainable management of peaty soils become available.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="organically-farmed-land-1">Organically farmed land</h4>

<p>To ensure value for public money, we expect that organically farmed land will be entered into the intermediate level of this standard.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-the-improved-grassland-soils-standard-works">
    <span class="number">13.4 </span>How the improved grassland soils standard works</h3>

<p>The improved grassland soils standard has a set of aims. You achieve these aims by completing the land management actions for this standard. The details of the actions explain what you need to do, when to do it and each action’s aim.</p>

<p>If you enter a land parcel into the improved grassland soils standard, it cannot be selected for the other 2 standards available in 2022. In future, some standards will be compatible with each other, and you’ll be able to have a land parcel in more than one standard, where this is the case.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="different-levels-1">Different levels</h4>

<p>The actions are grouped into two levels:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>introductory</li>
    <li>intermediate</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the actions are the same in both levels. There’s one additional action in the intermediate level.</p>

<p>You can select different levels for different land parcels entered into this standard. For example, you can enter one land parcel into the introductory level and another land parcel into the intermediate level.</p>

<p>An advanced level is likely to be available from 2023 onwards. You’ll be able to upgrade your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement annually to increase levels for existing standards in your agreement.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="payment-1">Payment</h4>

<p>The total annual payment you receive depends on the number of hectares (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) of eligible land you enter into each level.</p>

<table class="govuk-table">
    <thead class="govuk-table__head">
        <tr class="govuk-table__row">
            <th class="govuk-table__header" scope="col">Level</th>
            <th class="govuk-table__header" scope="col">Total annual payment</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody class="govuk-table__body">
        <tr class="govuk-table__row">
            <td class="govuk-table__cell">Introductory</td>
            <td class="govuk-table__cell">£28 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="govuk-table__row">
            <td class="govuk-table__cell">Intermediate</td>
            <td class="govuk-table__cell">£58 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This means if you enter:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> into the introductory level, your total annual payment is based on 20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> x £28 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</li>
    <li>20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> into the intermediate level, your total annual payment is based on 20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> x £58 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are paid for all the eligible hectares entered into the standard, even if the action only has to be completed on a percentage area of that land.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-complete-the-actions-1">When to complete the actions</h4>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement starts, you should complete the actions in this standard. This is explained in the details of the actions under ‘When to do it’.</p>

<p>If your agreement starts too late for you to complete an action, you can complete it within 12 months of your agreement start date.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="checking-progress-of-your-sfi-standards-agreement">Checking progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h4>

<p>If we check progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you’ll only be asked for evidence of what you’ve done to complete the action if it’s not clear that the aim has been achieved. The details of each action explain what evidence to keep.</p>

    <span class="number">13.5 </span>Summary of the actions</h3>

<p>The introductory level actions are:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>action 1: complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan </li>
    <li>action 2: test soil organic matter</li>

    <span class="number">13.6 </span>Action 1: Complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-to-do-4">What to do</h4>

<p>You must complete an assessment of your soil and produce a written soil management plan covering all the land parcels entered into this standard.</p>

<p>If you already have a written soil management plan informed by a soil assessment, you can use it to meet this action.</p>

<p>To help us improve national data on the condition of England’s soils, you’ll need to provide some information when we ask you for it as part of the soils strategy once it’s launched. This will include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>basic information from your soil assessment</li>
    <li>the soil organic matter test results under action 2</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is one of the public goods that the standard is paying for and part of wider government measures in relation to our future soils strategy.</p>

<p>We’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about what basic information is needed and how to supply it to us.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-do-it-4">When to do it</h4>

<p>You must complete the soil assessment and produce the written soil management plan within the first 12 months of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. You must review the soil management plan each year of your agreement, adding any new soil analysis you do.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-do-it-4">How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. You can record the soil management plan on paper or digitally.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the guidance about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-improved-grassland-soils-standard" class="govuk-link">how to assess your soils and produce a soil management plan</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="the-actions-aim-4">The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim, which is for you to have:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>assessed the soil for all the land entered into this standard</li>
    <li>produced a written soil management plan for that land</li>
</ul>

<p>This will help you to plan how to increase the long-term health and productivity of your soil.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-evidence-to-keep-4">What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a record of your soil management plan, including your soil assessment. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="action-2-test-soil-organic-matter-1">
    <span class="number">13.7 </span>Action 2: Test soil organic matter</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-to-do-5">What to do</h4>

<p>You must make sure the soil for all the land parcels entered into this standard have been tested for soil organic matter (<abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr>) within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>You can use existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results to meet this action, but they cannot be more than 5 years old.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-do-it-5">When to do it</h4>

<p>During your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must make sure that each land parcel entered into this standard has been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>If your existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results reach 5 years old, you must retest that land parcel.</p>

<p>If you have not tested some or all of the land parcels entered into this standard for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years, you should try to do this during the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If this timing is not possible because the laboratory that does your <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> tests does not have capacity, you must make sure that:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the tests for these land parcels are done as soon as possible</li>
    <li>all of these land parcels have been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years by the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, you must also write to us to explain why you have not:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>retested land parcels for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> when existing test results reached 5 years old</li>
    <li>completed <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> testing during the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement for land parcels not tested within the last 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p>You may choose to carry out this action at the same time as your other routine soil testing required in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/farming-rules-for-water-in-england" class="govuk-link">Farming Rules for Water</a>.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-do-it-5">How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action.

    <span class="number">13.8 </span>Action 3: Minimise bare ground over winter</h3>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-to-do-6">What to do</h4>

<p>You must make sure that no more than 5% of the total area of land entered into the standard is left bare, or becomes bare, over winter.</p>

<p>Bare land is any area of land where the soil is not covered by vegetation and is directly exposed to the elements.</p>

<p>You must not leave any land bare over winter if it’s at high risk of erosion or run-off.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-do-it-6">When to do it</h4>

<p>Each year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must have no more than 5% of the land entered into this standard as bare ground from the start of December until the end of February.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="how-to-do-it-6">How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="the-actions-aim-6">The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that there’s minimal bare ground across all of the land entered into this standard over winter.</p>

<p>This will help to protect the soil surface. It will also provide root growth that maintains soil structure, supports soil biology and minimises nutrient leaching, soil erosion and runoff.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="what-evidence-to-keep-6">What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You should keep photographs and other documentation to show what you’ve done to complete this action. This will help if it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the aim. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

    <li>2-metre or 1-metre cross compliance buffers required under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2022/gaec-1-establishment-of-buffer-strips-along-watercourses" class="govuk-link">GAEC 1</a>

    <li>2-metre cross compliance green cover requirement under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2022/gaec-7a-boundaries" class="govuk-link">GAEC 7a</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can do this on a single area of land for the duration of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Alternatively, you can move the area used for the herbal leys around the land parcels entered into this standard each year.</p>

<p>You must not establish herbal leys on:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>any area that’s a Site of Special Scientific Interest (<abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>)</li>
    <li>any area with historic or archaeological features, as identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You should not complete this action on any area of ‘peaty soil’. Peaty soil means there’s around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more. You may already know if there is peaty soil on your land. If you do not know, the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results from completing action 2 will tell you.</p>

<p>You’ll still be paid for this area, even though you cannot complete the action on it.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="when-to-do-it-7">When to do it</h4>

<p>You must establish the herbal ley in the first 12 months of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. If you’ve already established a herbal ley, you can maintain it to meet this action.</p>

<p>You must maintain the herbal ley on at least 15% of the land entered into this level of the standard for the 3-year duration of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>
