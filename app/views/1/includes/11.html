<p>We will use a new, supportive approach for checking progress of your Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement and that you’ve met its terms and conditions.</p>

<p>If you cannot deliver your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, we’ll start by helping you to fix what’s gone wrong, wherever possible. Unlike previous schemes, there will be no additional financial ‘penalties’ applied.</p>

<p>The standards have been designed to include actions that you should be able to complete, to achieve the set of aims for each standard. You must do what’s required, but it’s up to you how to complete the actions, so you can make them work for your farm.</p>

<p>While the actions avoid being prescriptive, some do require you to complete an action on a percentage of land entered into the standard. In this case, it’s worth allowing a margin of error.</p>

<p>For example, in the arable and horticultural soils standard you must have at least 70% winter cover on land entered into the standard. You may want to try to do this on a slightly larger area.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-we-may-check">
    <span class="number">10.1 </span>What we may check</h3>

<p>During your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, we may check that you are:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>meeting your agreement’s terms and conditions</li>
    <li>achieving the aims of the standards, by completing the required actions in a way that works on your farm</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-well-check-your-agreement">
    <span class="number">10.2 </span>How we’ll check your agreement</h3>

<p>We’ll use a range of methods to check progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, including:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>reviewing the annual declaration that you submit</li>
    <li>checking evidence we ask a proportion of agreement holders to supply, such as a soil management plan or soil organic matter test results</li>
    <li>carrying out site visits (physical or by video call) for a proportion of agreement holders</li>
    <li>using remote monitoring technology, such as aerial photography and satellite imagery</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="annual-declaration">Annual declaration</h4>

<p>You must submit an annual declaration for each year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. This is to confirm your progress on completing the actions in your agreement. Read about <a href="how-a-sfi-standards-agreement-works#submit-an-annual-declaration-to-confirm-progress-of-your-agreement" class="govuk-link">submitting an annual declaration to confirm progress of your agreement</a>.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="evidence-you-need-to-keep">Evidence you need to keep</h4>

<p>You can find out what evidence to keep for each action in the details of each standard. The evidence will show what you’ve done to complete the action. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

<p>By completing all of the actions under the level selected for the standards, you should achieve the set of aims for that standard. The aim for each action is also explained in the details of each standard.</p>

<p>If we check progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the action’s aim, we may ask you for the evidence to show what you’ve done to complete the action.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="site-visits">Site visits</h4>

<p>If your farm is selected for a site visit, we’ll try to arrange a suitable time and date with you in advance and let you know what to expect during the visit.</p>

<p>If that’s not possible, we’ll write to you by post or email explaining the purpose, date and time of the visit. This will be at least 48 hours before the visit.</p>

<p>An RPA field officer will then visit your farm. In most cases, the site visit will involve a discussion with you about how:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the aims of the standards in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement have been achieved</li>
    <li>the actions in the standards have been completed</li>
</ul>

<p>Where necessary to guide improvements, the RPA field officer will be able to conduct a review of all aspects of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>Read <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/405/part/6/made" class="govuk-link">the legislation</a> for the exact details of what someone visiting (or ‘authorised person’) can do.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="remote-monitoring">Remote monitoring</h4>

<p>Remote monitoring uses aerial photography and satellite imagery to monitor things like land cover, vegetation condition and soil erosion risk.</p>

<p>Remote monitoring aims to:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>reduce the number of physical site visits</li>
    <li>make sure the standards are delivering environmental benefits</li>
    <li>automatically identify potential issues so that you can be given targeted support and guidance</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-happens-if-you-cannot-deliver-your-agreement-or-your-circumstances-change">
    <span class="number">10.3 </span>What happens if you cannot deliver your agreement, or your circumstances change</h3>

<p>If you find that you cannot deliver your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, we’ll try to be flexible and start by helping you to fix what’s gone wrong.</p>

<p>You may be unable to deliver your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement because something happens that:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>prevents you completing the required actions</li>
    <li>affects how you can deliver your agreement</li>
    <li>means your circumstances change</li>
</ul>

<p>This may be for reasons within or outside your control.</p>

<p>If this is the case, you must <a href="contacting-the-rpa-about-sfi" class="govuk-link">notify us</a>, in writing, as soon as reasonably practicable, if that change of circumstances affects:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>your eligibility</li>
    <li>the amount of money you should get</li>
    <li>your ability to deliver actions in the standards within your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> agreement</li>
    <li>your ability to comply with scheme terms and conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>When you write to us, you should include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>)</li>
    <li>your agreement reference number</li>
    <li>as many details as possible about the change of circumstances, including specific details about the standards you’re having issues with</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll look at each change of circumstances on a case-by-case basis. Depending on what’s happened, we may decide to:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>amend your agreement</li>
    <li>end your agreement early</li>
    <li>adjust your payments</li>
    <li>ask you to repay money already paid to you</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not agree with our decision, you can use the complaints process to ask for it to be reconsidered. You must do this within 60 calendar days of the date you are notified of our decision.</p>

<p>It will be a breach of your agreement if you do not tell us about the change of circumstances when you are required to.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-you-could-breach-your-agreement">
    <span class="number">10.4 </span>How you could breach your agreement</h3>

<p>You could breach your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if you do not meet its terms and conditions.</p>

<p>This includes if you:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>do not complete the actions required in the standards</li>
    <li>do not report, as soon as reasonably practicable, a change of circumstances which affects your ability to deliver your agreement</li>
    <li>give false or misleading information</li>
    <li>do not provide information or evidence when it’s asked for, in the way it’s asked for</li>
    <li>prevent a site visit from being carried out</li>
    <li>refuse to assist an authorised person during a site visit</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-happens-if-there-has-been-a-suspected-breach">
    <span class="number">10.5 </span>What happens if there has been a suspected breach</h3>

<p>We may find a suspected breach during checks on the progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. If this happens, we will investigate the suspected breach. Unlike previous schemes, we will not usually withhold your payments if a breach is suspected.</p>

<p>Where possible we’ll discuss this investigation with you, so you understand what we’ve considered. You may also be asked to supply further information or evidence to us as part of this investigation.</p>

<p>Once we’ve completed our investigation, we’ll tell you the outcome. If you do not agree with the outcome, you’ll have the opportunity to make written representations on why you do not agree. When we write to you with the outcome of the investigation, we’ll explain how to make written representations, including the time limit for submitting these to us.</p>

<p>We’ll consider your written representations before making a formal determination on whether there has been a breach.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-happens-if-a-breach-is-confirmed">
    <span class="number">10.6 </span>What happens if a breach is confirmed</h3>

<p>If we decide that there has been a breach of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, we’ll write to inform you of this within a reasonable period. We’ll give you the reasons for this decision. We’ll then decide what action needs to be taken, if any.</p>

<p>To do this, we’ll look at the individual circumstances of your case and consider various factors such as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the seriousness of the breach</li>
    <li>if you had a good reason for the breach</li>
    <li>why the breach happened and any consequences it may have</li>
    <li>what impact the breach has on delivering the aims of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, and whether that impact will be short or longer term</li>
    <li>if you can take action to make sure you are delivering your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
    <li>any past conduct and whether similar breaches have happened before</li>
    <li>if you intentionally breached your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
    <li>whether the breach constitutes an offence and has caused widespread or irreparable damage</li>
    <li>if you have not co-operated with us checking on your progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
    <li>whether you’ve notified us about a change of circumstances, if relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not agree with our decision, you can use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/rural-payments-agency/about/complaints-procedure" class="govuk-link">complaints procedure</a> to ask for it to be reconsidered. You must do this within 60 calendar days of the date you are notified about our decision.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="good-reasons-for-a-breach">
    <span class="number">10.7 </span>Good reasons for a breach</h3>

<p>There may be a ‘good reason’ for a breach of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, for reasons outside your control.</p>

<p>In this case, you (or someone authorised to act on your behalf) must write to us to explain this.</p>

<p>You must write to us immediately if your good reason relates to you:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>preventing us from carrying out a site visit,</li>
    <li>refusing to provide assistance with a site visit</li>
</ul>

<p>In all other cases, you must do this within 8 weeks from either the date:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>you are able to</li>
    <li>we notify you of the breach</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, we’ll also take good reasons into account when we investigate suspected breaches. During this investigation, if we agree that there are good reasons for a breach, we may be able to tell you during that investigation what, if anything, needs to be done.</p>

<p>Good reasons for a breach include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>natural events, such as prolonged adverse weather conditions, flooding, or animal or plant disease</li>
    <li>if you are seriously ill</li>
    <li>the death of an agreement holder</li>
    <li>unforeseen loss of management control of land, for example when a tenancy is terminated, or because of the compulsory purchase of land by a third party</li>
    <li>financial circumstances, such as bankruptcy</li>
    <li>evidenced supply chain problems, such as a lack of soil testing capacity</li>
    <li>criminal damage by a third party, such as arson or vandalism</li>
</ul>

<p>When you <a href="contacting-the-rpa-about-sfi" class="govuk-link">write to us</a>, you should include your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>), agreement reference number and explain:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>what has happened</li>
    <li>what good reason led to the breach</li>
    <li>whether you can fix the problem</li>
    <li>how the good reason meant you were unable to deliver your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
    <li>any evidence or information that may support your case</li>
</ul>

<p>We will then:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>consider your individual situation and may ask for additional evidence</li>
    <li>decide what action, if any, needs to be taken</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are aware of the issue when entering into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, it’s unlikely we’ll consider it to be a good reason for a breach.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-action-we-may-take-when-there-is-a-breach">
    <span class="number">10.8 </span>What action we may take when there is a breach</h3>

<p>We may not take any action at all depending on:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the nature of the breach</li>
    <li>any evidence you supply of a good reason for the breach</li>
</ul>

<p>If we need to take action, we’ll look at what you can do to fix what’s gone wrong with the delivery of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. We may also consider taking more formal action to deal with the breach.</p>

<p>If we need to take more formal action, you may have to repay some or all of the payments already made to you. This is because your payments are based on you completing the actions in the standards for a full agreement year, including submitting your annual declaration. A full agreement year means each 12-month period from the start date of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If you have to make a repayment, there will be no additional financial ‘penalties’ applied, as used to be applied under previous schemes.</p>

<p>If we decide it’s possible for you to fix what’s gone wrong with the delivery of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, we will write to you and explain what you must do.</p>

<p>If you do this within the relevant full agreement year, you will not have to repay payments already received for that year.</p>

<p>If you do not do this within the relevant full agreement year, you will not have completed all the actions you need to. This means you will have to repay payments already received for that year. We may also amend your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Depending on the circumstances, your future payments may be reduced or withheld.</p>

<p>We may decide that there is a serious breach because it was:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>intentional</li>
    <li>due to negligence or recklessness</li>
    <li>has happened more than once, without good reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case of a serious breach, we could:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>end your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
    <li>prevent you from receiving payments under any other financial assistance scheme for up to 2 years.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where there is evidence of fraud or illegality, we will pursue that in line with the law on those issues.</p>

<br />
