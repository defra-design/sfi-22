<p>This information explains the interaction between land entered into a Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement and other schemes, as well as other funding sources.</p>

<p>Existing schemes will continue to run alongside <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, such as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>), until it is delinked in 2024</li>
    <li>Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>)</li>
    <li>Environmental Stewardship</li>
</ul>

<p>By the end of 2024, new schemes will also be launched, including:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Local Nature Recovery</li>
    <li>Landscape Recovery</li>
</ul>

    <span class="number">6.1 </span>Including land in an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and other schemes at the same time</h3>

<p>It’s possible to include the same land in an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and another scheme if:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>you and your land are eligible for each scheme</li>
    <li>the activities or outcomes you’re being paid for under each scheme are compatible</li>
    <li>you are not being paid for a similar activity or outcome on the same area of land at the same time (known as double funding)</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="basic-payment-scheme">
    <span class="number">6.2 </span>Basic Payment Scheme</h3>

<p>You can include the same land parcel in a <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> application and your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, as long as it’s eligible for each scheme.</p>

<p>If you apply for the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lump-sum-payments-for-farmers-who-leave-or-retire-from-farming-and-delinked-payments/lump-sum-exit-scheme-and-delinked-payments-how-the-payments-will-work" class="govuk-link">Lump Sum Exit Scheme</a> in 2022, you should not apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. If you decide to withdraw your Lump Sum Exit Scheme application, you can then apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="countryside-stewardship">
    <span class="number">6.3 </span>Countryside Stewardship</h3>

<p>The interaction between an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> is different depending on whether there’s a revenue option or capital items funding.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="cs-revenue-options">
    <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options</h4>

<p>If land used for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option has an eligible land cover and is an eligible land type for the standard you choose, you can enter it into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> actions, including their timing, are compatible with the actions in the standard you choose</li>
    <li>you won’t be paid twice for a similar activity or outcome on the same area of land at the same time (known as double funding)</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is not the case, the ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option land, including any land currently used for an ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option, cannot:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>be entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
    <li>be used to complete any of the actions in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, you cannot enter:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>an area of land used to establish a cover crop under <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> into the arable and horticultural soils standard, or use it to meet the actions in that standard</li>
    <li>an area of land used for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> grass buffer strip on an improved grassland parcel into the improved grassland soils standard, or use it to meet the actions in that standard</li>
</ul>

<p>The standard you choose affects which <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options are compatible and do not lead to double funding.</p>

<h5 class="govuk-heading-s" id="cs-revenue-options-and-the-moorland-standard">
    <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options and the moorland standard</h5>

<p>Land used for all <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options can be entered into the introductory level of the moorland standard, if it has an eligible land cover and is an eligible land type.</p>

<p>This is because the introductory level of the moorland standard does not involve physical land management actions, so there is no incompatibility or double funding.</p>

<h5 class="govuk-heading-s" id="cs-revenue-options-and-the-soils-standards">
    <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options and the soils standards</h5>

<p>You can enter land used for certain <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options into the introductory and intermediate levels in the <a href="{{ anchor }}arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard" class="govuk-link">arable and horticultural soils standard</a> or the <a href="{{ anchor }}improved-grassland-soils-standard" class="govuk-link">improved grassland soils standard</a> in 2022.</p>

<p>If you use an area of a land parcel for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option not listed in tables 1 and 2 above, that area cannot be entered into the soils standards.</p>

<p>However, you can enter the rest of the land parcel not covered by an ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option into either of the soils standards (if it’s eligible land for the chosen standard).</p>

<p>For example, if part of a land parcel is used for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> grass buffer strip, you can enter the rest of the area into either of the soils standards.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="rotational-cs-revenue-options">Rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options</h4>

<p>A rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option is a multi-annual land management option that can be moved around identified land parcels in your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement.</p>

<p>Each year of your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement, you declare the area currently used for a rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> option. You do this either:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>on the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> annual revenue claim, usually submitted by 15 May each year</li>
    <li>by 1 September in the relevant year if you cannot declare its location on the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> annual revenue claim</li>
</ul>

<p>Any area within a land parcel that’s currently used for an ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option cannot be entered into the soils standards.</p>

<p>You can enter the rest of the land parcel not covered by an ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option into either of the soils standards (if it’s eligible land for the chosen standard).</p>

<p>The area currently used for an ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option will be automatically removed from the ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This means the total area entered into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement does not include the area currently used for an ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option.</p>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement has started, the ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option area can be moved around the land parcels in your agreement. This is because we’ve already removed that area from your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. However, this is only possible if the area of the ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option does not exceed the area automatically removed from the ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p>For example, a land parcel currently includes 2ha of SW6. That area is automatically removed from that land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement has started, you can move that 2ha of SW6 around the land parcels in your agreement. However, if the area of SW6 increases to 2.5ha in either the second or third year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you’ll need to add land to your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement at the annual upgrade point to accommodate the additional 0.5ha.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="applying-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement-if-you-have-an-existing-cs-agreement">Applying for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if you have an existing <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement</h4>

<p>If you have an existing <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement, we will automatically remove the area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options from the affected land parcels in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This includes any area currently used for ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options.</p>

<p>This means the area is not included in the affected land parcel’s ‘available area’ for you to select in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. For example, if there is a 10 hectare (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) land parcel which has 2 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of AB2 (Basic overwinter stubble), the ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application will be 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</p>

<p>You may be applying for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Higher Tier or Mid Tier (including the Wildlife Offers) agreement starting from 1 January 2023. This may affect your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application if you include the same area of land in both <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> and <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you submit your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application and receive your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement offer before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, any area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options can be confirmed before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>.</p>

<p>In this case, we will automatically remove the area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options from the affected land parcels in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This includes any area currently used for ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options.</p>

<p>This means the area isn’t included in the affected land parcel’s ‘available area’ for you to select in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p>However, if the area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options cannot be confirmed, it won’t be possible to automatically remove it from your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This will be the case if you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> before you submit your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application.</p>

<p>This means the area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options is included in the affected land parcel’s ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. You can only enter the total ‘available area’ into the standard you choose. It cannot be reduced in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application to remove the area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options.</p>

<p>If you enter the same area of land into both an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> soils standard and an ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option in a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement that starts from 1 January 2023, your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> payment will be automatically adjusted.</p>

<p>For example, you enter a 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> land parcel into one of the soils standards and include that same land parcel in your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application. You have only included 1 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of this land parcel in your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application, but it’s in an ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option for the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> soils standard you have chosen. If your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement starts after your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you will only be eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> payment on 9 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of that land parcel.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="cs-capital-items-funding">
    <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> capital items funding</h4>

<p>If you apply for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Capital Grants agreement, the same land parcel can be entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="environmental-stewardship">
    <span class="number">6.4 </span>Environmental Stewardship</h3>

<p>If land used for an Environmental Stewardship (ES) revenue option has an eligible land cover and is an eligible land type for the standard you choose, you can enter it into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the ES actions, including their timing, are compatible with the actions in the standard you choose</li>
    <li>you won’t be paid twice for a similar activity or outcome on the same area of land at the same time (known as double funding)</li>

<p>If this is not the case, the ineligible ES revenue option land, including any land currently used for an ineligible rotational ES revenue option, cannot be:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

<p>For example, you cannot enter an area of land:</p>

<p>The standard you choose affects which ES revenue options are compatible and do not lead to double funding.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="es-revenue-options-and-the-moorland-standard">ES revenue options and the moorland standard</h4>

<p>Land used for ES revenue options can be entered into the introductory level of the moorland standard if it has an eligible land cover and is an eligible land type.</p>

<p>This is because the introductory level of the moorland standard does not involve physical land management actions, so there is no incompatibility or double funding.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="es-revenue-options-and-the-soils-standards">ES revenue options and the soils standards</h4>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="rotational-es-revenue-options">Rotational ES revenue options</h4>

<p>A rotational ES revenue option is a multi-annual land management option that can be moved around identified land parcels in your ES agreement.</p>

<p>Each year of your ES agreement, you declare the area currently used for a rotational ES option. You do this either:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>on the ES annual revenue claim, usually submitted by 15 May each year</li>
    <li>by 1 September in the relevant year if you cannot declare its location on the ES annual revenue claim</li>
</ul>

<p>Any area within a land parcel that’s currently used for an ineligible rotational ES revenue option cannot be entered into the soils standards.</p>

<p>The area currently used for an ineligible rotational ES revenue option will be automatically removed from the ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This means the total area entered into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement does not include the area currently used for an ineligible rotational ES revenue option.</p>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement has started, the ineligible rotational ES revenue option area can be moved around the land parcels in your agreement. This is because we’ve already removed that area from your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. However, this is only possible if the area of the ineligible rotational ES revenue option does not exceed the area automatically removed from the ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="applying-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement-if-you-have-an-existing-es-agreement">Applying for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if you have an existing ES agreement</h4>

<p>If you have an existing ES agreement, we will automatically remove the area of ineligible ES revenue options from the affected land parcels in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This includes any area currently used for ineligible rotational ES revenue options.</p>

<p>This means the area is not included in the affected land parcel’s ‘available area’ for you to select in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-nature-recovery-more-information-on-how-the-scheme-will-work/local-nature-recovery-more-information-on-how-the-scheme-will-work" class="govuk-link">Local Nature Recovery</a> (LNR) is expected to launch by the end of 2024. You’ll be able to apply for LNR options on land entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, as long as the eligibility and compatibility requirements are met and there’s no double funding.</p>

<p>The LNR options will initially cover the following themes:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>managing feeding, shelter and breeding areas for wildlife on arable farms</li>
    <li>managing, restoring and creating grassland habitats such as species-rich grassland on farms and in the wider countryside</li>
    <li>managing, restoring and creating wetland habitats such as ponds, lakes, reedbeds and fens</li>
    <li>managing, restoring and creating lowland heathland</li>
    <li>managing, restoring and creating coastal habitats such as sand dunes, salt marsh and shingle</li>
    <li>managing and restoring areas of upland and lowland peat and moorland on farms and in the wider countryside</li>
    <li>targeted measures to support the recovery and reintroduction of particular wildlife species, such as creating and managing nesting and feeding habitat, and to tackle non-native invasive species</li>
    <li>managing and creating trees and woodlands, including agroforestry, traditional orchards and tree planting on areas of farms (the England Woodland Creation Offer will be the main scheme for creating woodland until 2025)</li>
    <li>nature-based solutions for water, such as creating and managing in-field vegetation, buffer strips and swales to reduce and filter runoff and contribute to natural flood management</li>
    <li>restoring rivers, flood plains, streams and riparian habitats</li>
</ul>

<p>More LNR guidance will be published on GOV.UK over the next year.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="landscape-recovery">
    <span class="number">6.7 </span>Landscape Recovery</h3>

<p>You can apply for Landscape Recovery on land entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, as long as the eligibility and compatibility requirements are met and there’s no double funding.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="farming-in-protected-landscapes">
    <span class="number">6.8 </span>Farming in Protected Landscapes</h3>

<p>If you have land in a National Park Authority or Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) you can apply for Farming in Protected Landscapes funding and enter that same land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, as long as the eligibility and compatibility requirements are met and there’s no double funding.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s" id="private-sector-schemes">Private sector schemes</h4>

<p>In 2022, you can enter the same area of land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and a private sector scheme arrangement, such as carbon trading or payments for natural flood management.</p>

<p>The approach to private sector schemes will be reviewed by <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.">Defra</abbr> annually.</p>
